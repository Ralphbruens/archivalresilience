### Research the artifact

---

Using the archive as a starting point for research is an interesting first step. By implying terms form archive to other search system and the other way around I find my way through the archive. I got interested by different artifact of Separatistic movements. Most of them were glorify violence and I started to question my self if there is also a non-violence way for resistance. I this the artifact about pirate radio and I saw that the archive is full information about.

### Radio is my Bomb

![Archival%20Resilience%20Bewegingsmedia/radio_0.jpg](Archival%20Resilience%20Bewegingsmedia/radio_0.jpg)

Cover of 'Radio is my bomb - A DIY Manual for pirates' by Hooligan press.

There is a value to act local. Create a (physical) network between different stations to provide and produce material for radio.

Veronica ship, Dutch offshore Radio Station

A pirate radio how-to guide published by *Hooligan Press* in London in April, 1987. The title comes from a quote from *Chantal Paternostre*, a Belgian anarchist who said it when arrested on trumped up terrorism charges. She worked for *Radio Air Libre*, a Brussels pirate radio station. She was eventually released from prison after more than a year detained: most of it in solitary confinement.

This artifact is a collection of information about pirate radio which is very interesting as an artifact for transcoding.

This publication was released because it became much more difficult to set up an pirate station. This publication contains story of successful and unsuccessful stations and how can we learn form this for future pirate radio

### Pirate Radio

Since this subject covers national territories, *international water* and international airspace, the only effective way to treat this subject is on a country by country, international waters and international airspace basis. Because the laws vary, the interpretation of the term pirate radio also varies considerably

Illegal use of licensed radio spectrum in several forms: Unlicensed operation, Inadvertent interference, Deliberate or malicious interference, Illegal equipment.

### Offshore

Offshore radio is radio broadcasting from ships or fixed maritime structures. Offshore broadcasters are usually unlicenced but transmissions are legal in international waters. This is in contrast to broadcasting without a licence on land or within a nation's territorial waters, which is usually unlawful.

### Preservation of the artifact

---

**Digitizing: scanning the publication.**

We can digitizing. But much in the text has been superseded by modern technology. So if we reproduce it for reference only. And how to preserve the digital data?

---

T**o audio:**

Using the techniques inside the publication to make a physchial reproduction of the Diy Manual which send out audio/produce audio.

---

**Translate to Instruction (Again)**  

Making an instruction for translation or recreation. A system that flexible to make for continuous refreshment. A linguistic solution. But after year do we still speak the same language and how to preserve the instruction?

### Piracy

The term piracy more generally designated the unauthorized usage or reproduction of copyright or patent-protected material. This is almost a far cry from the word’s original etymology.

Encryption, Open Sources, Download/Upload (Piratebay, MEGA etc)

**Sneaker-net**

Disappointed with the limitations of digital data transport, we turned to analogue transportation. Before digital networks, information was transported between two computers by simply using a floppy disk. This method of carrying digital information in an analogue way is called a ‘sneakernet’. Used in Burma in 2000 to smuggle data out of the country, it has been used for secure transportation of data. We chose to transport the data through sneaker net We knew people that travelled between the west and Iran, and we could use mobile devices to bring the stories back. All we had to do was to create an application capable of recording our stories with a relative safety.
