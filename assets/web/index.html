            <h1>RADIO IS MY BOMB - a DIY Manual for Pirates OCR Version </h1>
<p> INTRODUCTION
This book was put together due to popular demand by a bunch of pirates, with a lot of help from the Free
the Airwaves campaign and the D.R. Communications technical group in Bristol. Its been a long time coming
but well worth waiting for. This is the First Edition, January 1987, its still a bit rough but we hope to update it
regularily.
Its intended as a 'Do-It -Yourself' Pirate's Handbook, aimed at promoting neighbourhood, political and openaccess
radio pirates ... But obviously you can use it as you wish ... You can build the transmitters and use them to
jam out Aunty Beeb, you can play your favourite music, or you can set up local open-access stations as we
suggest...Or you can set up a fascist station and we'll come and kick your heads in!
This is an action propaganda book. We're not trying to 'cover the subject' or write an 'objective history'. We
do include a brief section on recent political pirates in Britain, and another on radio pirate s around the world.
But the only purpose of this is to illustrate hard learned lessons and brilliant ideas to help and inspire the 'would be'
pirate of tomorrow.
The practical 'How To Be A Radio Pirate' section is a much longer and more detailed version of the pamphlet
by Our Radio (the open-access pirate,1981-1983) which has been long out of print . This shou ld kill off
finally any 'technical mystery' on the subject which might be holding you back. It practically tells you how to
do up your shoelaces before venturing forth to put your message on the airwaves. Its mainly about FM piracy,
though we include a shorter section and a transmitter design for the less popular Medium Wave.
The aim of the large technical section is to spread the art of transmitter building from the few semi-professional
technicians to the l000's of eager electronics enthusiasts all over the world. Its just about possible for the
complete beginner to build a transmitter from this book. And you can write to Free The Airwaves and D.R.
Communications , who are more than happy to give you help and advice with problems as you go along. We also
include projects for the more advanced, and contacts for obtaining still more advanced designs.
We also include a section on the legal situation in Britain, and a good range of contacts for current radio
pirates and technical info sources. And 40 Elizabethan sonnets to round it all off.
Its quite logical really that this handbook was finally produced and printed by anarchists. No one else
(least of all political parties) looks forward with glee to the undermining of the Institutions of The State, or
to setting the radio media free for you and me and Joanna Soap to use as we wish!
Forward: LET 1000 AERIALS
RADIATE Welcome to 'Radio is my Bomb' . This ls it, at last
the manual of the guerrilla pirate, as complete as
we can make it. Of course there have been radio pirates
since rad io was discovered, Marconi himself became
the 1st pi rat e , when the authorities prevented
him fully using h i s own discovery. But in the last
10 years, with the pop ulari t y of FM radio, becoming
a pirate has bec ome ever cheaper and more simple.
You can't go out and buy a tr ansm itt er at the corner
shop, but you can buy a ll the components . Now at last
using the information in this book, and for the price
of a couple of dole cheques , you and your friends
can comeon air on the half empty FM band as a local
station.
In other countries, (Prance, Belgium,Italy,Holland
and now Spain), the State has tried to control and
own the radio waves, and simply been flooded by an
uncontrollable mob of largely commercial local PM
pirates.
We want that to happen here too . Thats why we made
th i s book. But we' re not too keen on the commercial
pirates, who spend their time trying to hog the tech nology
imitate the commercial trash stat i ons, an d
even sabotage the competition, and all to make quick
cash for the businessmen who run them. The 'Pree Market'
is only fr ee for the rich and powerful. Repeati
ng tracks and ads at - intervals designed by computer
to entrap the non · existant average MAN into buying
their crap, till every stat i on sounds exactly
the same.
Nor are we turned on anymore by the trad 1 t i ona 1
pirate DJ's, who tend to be all the same white sexi st
macho morons, preening their egos and spewing forth
inane chatter i n the hope of getting a fa t career
in the legal med ia.
We'd like instead to put everyone on air! To rec laim
the airwaves from t he parasites who infest it .
1.
We'd like to see ethnic radio, womens radio, tenants,
un ions, anarchists, community groups, old people,
prisoners, pacifists, urban gorillas, local
info, gays, straights and of course every possible
·· variety of musical entertainment.
A few people have tried to start these kinds of
pirate stations in the recent past but have been stamped
on by the State (by both Tory and Labour Governments).
we can learn quite a lot from their experience,
which we go into in following chapters. One
thing thats clear is the value of numbers, simply
that they can't stamp on everyone.
Another lesson is the value of be i ng local, first
of all because its much more di f ficult for the nasties
to track and catch you, and less rewarding when
they do, and second! y because there's a 'commercial
gap', people can't make much money out of local stations
, while anti-commercial pirates could survive
and thrive. There is anot her reason why we're pushing
for a new wave of local pirates , because we think
rad i o should be a two way thing, with as much feedback
as possible and lots of groups taking part and
making their own shows. To hell with Broadcasting
Authorities, Peers. Lords, Judges, MIS moles and pontificating
middle class professionals!
You may now be thin king this is an anarchist book
trying to create chaos just to get back at Big Brothe
r. Think what you lik e. We'd prefer radio chaos
to the 'aural diahorrea' we have r i ght now! But in
fact chaos has nothing to do with it. For a start
there's plenty of r oom, ' Free The Airwaves' have calculated
there's room for 471 one mile FM pirates in
London alone without interfering with anyone (then
of course there's the space the police have 'p i rated'
and will eventually have to move off). We're talking
abo ut cooperation, not chaos and competition. About
open access radio, where all kinds of people can share
facilit i es and put out occasional shows or info
as they wi sh. We're talking about frequency shar ing,
about community defence , about each ethn i c group having
programmes in their own language, etc. And when
such a wave of local pirates begins we'll be talking
aboutnetworks, or a 111ovement, or a federation, or
whatever we wi sh to call it. Like for instance the
federations of the anti-commercial p ir ates in France
or Spain ( see International Section). So that
problems and overlaps can be amicably sorted out
and repression can be fought togetner. And we say
now that any future Federation should be anti-commercial,
and ban racists, fascists, sexists and all political
parties from our ranks!
This may all seem a bit idealistic, and what is
wrong with that! Any new · wave of pirates will come
from people and popular culture. It will certainly
NOT come from the 'broad left', divided as they are
in 100 fragments competing for power, melllbers and
soft jobs i n a Labour Party regime. Nor wi ll the
new pirates come from the ''Community Rad i o'' (CR)
movement, called i nto being by nazi Norman h i mse lf ,
and when denied licences have proved incapable of
putting a single pirate on air, for fear of breaking
the law. Now the CR activists are waiting for grants
and token controlled licenses under Labour. These
SLUMPies (Socialist Leaning Upwardly Mobile Persons )
should beware, socialists love state control even
more than Tories. Consider the Eastern Block with
totally controlled media and pirates hunted down by
police and army. The Labour Party has been the biggest
pirate-buster of all (as well as bringing in Nuke
Power, the Bomb, Internment etc) and even t ried to
jam Radio North Sea off the air (in 1970).
We are optimistic nevertheless . in fact we're quite
sure the FM band will f i ll up with pirates again,
simply because the technology is becoming so cheap
and simple. The· State knows this quite well, and
seeks to postpone it with the carrot of controlled
' 'Community' ' Radio and the big stick of the latest
anti-pirate laws. This is where the real battle lies,
and why we devote so much of this book to 'How to
get away with it' . In fact its a complete myth that
'political' pirates g:e.t busted more often than others
and even a half dozen 'open access ' stations could
flout the present laws, with a little organisat i on
and i magination. But the State has more strings to
its bow than brute force, as the history of pirates
in other countries shows. If they can't bust us off
the air, for whatever reason, they may try to buy
us off - legalise a few under their control, infiltrate
them with mi ddle class professionals who will
spout their ideology (they don't have to arrange this
, these people will descend like locusts), and crack
down harder on the rest . If this tactic failed to
work , for whatever reason,

on the. 'Italian' solution. What happened there
was there were suddenly so many pirates t hat the State
just declared a free for al l, in the knowledge
that the big commercial, party and re li gious stations
thus created would eventua l y swamp the autonomous
pirates off t he air!
Some people still naively think that radio is somehow
unbiased .. Think again!. Apart from the author it arian
BBC and IBA control by rich peop le with upper
class views, the kind of people employed can be r eli
ed on to spout t he pre judi ces and preconceptions
of their class (and this before thinking of the now
proven infiltration by MIS state agents!). Of cours e
if you 're a nationalist, sex i st, fascistic little
SUN lover you may notice nothing amiss. Its i nteresting
the way we' re Condit i oned and control le d by the
medi a , you can look at it by listing the people, sub jects,
v i ews , mus ic , languages etc left out or barely
represented. Or consider where the news on radio
actually comes fro m and why its c hosen as important.
When you say 'Fr ee The Airwaves' you need to work
out what you mean by Freedom. We know what WE want,
and its a lot more than a 2 mi nute phone-in slot caged
in the 'media zoo ' . This book is for people willing
to think, who know quite well what they want,
and are prepared to take simple practical steps towards
making a new real ity from their own dreams, and
even to have some fun in the process. The empty dia l

Regular Our Rad i o broadcasts began in Feb 82 . It
was anno unc ed as an open access station, and peo ple
were invited to make programmes. But the respon s e
was very slow . \.le had chosen 103.8, a t t he top end
of he waveband beyond the police, as our f r eque nc y
as it was officially declared an unused channe l (l ater
a whole range of pirates fo ll owed us) but we had
no ready made aud i ence l ike the mus i c p ir ates . We
had to f i ght f or our audience by putting out regular •
programmes. A big problem was that there was no support
network, and no income but wha t we put in ourse
l ves (but we were most l y on the dole) or ra is ed
from a few bene fi t gigs. We knew that at a certain
point we'd ga i n publicity and a mass following, and
so get the people and cash to expand and make us very
hard to stop . We chose Wednesday nights, with the
ide a of gett i ng quietly establ i shed, at that time
raids were no r mally made at the weekends. For a long
time this tactic worked, but listener supp o rt sti 11
didn't materialise. It seemed that passive consump tion

as any other . Nor could we go live, or do phone-ins,

were close to this when the final busts began). ,~, ._. . One programme to join early and stay with us was

Andromeda
Andromeda Independent Radio began on Jan 23rd 1979 ,
broadcasting from the Pennin es to the Manchester, Sth
East Lancashire area. Andromeda didn't belong to any organi
sation, or rent its gear from anyone, they were non•profir making
and decided everything at collec tive meetings .. "We believe
that community radio CANNOT be commercial radio ... We
broadcast : Greenpeace info , tapes of local bands , details
of anti-nuclear/ CND activities in our reception area and details
of times/frequencies of land based pirates" . They also carried
'inver ted advertising' which they called the 'Instant Rip Off'
show , publicising goods making excess profits or just being
shit.
Andromeda were an excellent advertisement for low•
power loca l piracy. They claimed their transmitter had
only ½ watt power, yet could be heard 35 miles away from
their broadcast site in the hills, and they produced recep tion
reports to prove it . The TX cost them a mere £6, and they
were ab le to tran smit so far due to their height and by using
a directional aerial with 'ga in' .. Andromeda were partly
inspired by an earlier station, Radio Aquarius, which broadcast
in the same area every weekend from April 1971 to May 1975 .
Aquarius finally gave up after repeated busts, one which followed
a programme condemning the treatment of Black workers
in South Africa. Andromeda t-00 went for a long time and
were busted several times before closing down around 1982.
Radio Active
Radio Active was another small a narchist pirate,
who broadcast in the Tottenham area of North London
in 1980. The collective put out a series of excellent
programmes, concen trating on a nti nuc l ea r and
anar cha - feminist issues, before closing due to other
committments, they weren't busted . People inspired
by Radio Active later went into Our Radio.
Radio Avalon
Radio Avalon was a 'Fes tival Pirate' a precursor of Sheffield
Peace Radio, which took to the airwaves to en tert ain and
inform the 30,000 crowd at the 1983 Glastonbury CND Fest•
iva l, broadcasting 72 ho urs of programmes. It was very well
received, and broadast with a tiny 1 watt transmitter, which
covered the whole site and nearby Pilton village.

Cambridge
Community Radio
We' r e sor ry not to have a ful 1 report on CCR ( see
next edition!). Cambridge Community Radio began as
an access station broadcasting music and l ocal community
news, an d developed in to something more radical,
unti.l it was put off the al r, with a series
of heavy \>usts i n 1983. People from CCR then took
responsib il ty for deve lopin~ the Free The Airwaves
Network and Campaign over the next couple of years,
and produced a series of well researched t ec hnic al,
legal and news bull et ins, befo re pass i ng the job on
to a Lon.don based group.
SHEFFIELD PEACE RADIO. SPR
The idea of SPR came from Radio Avalon in 1983.
At the time some CND supporters were flirting wit h
the i dea of setting up their own media in response
to the alinost total blackout by the press, TV and
radio of their activities.
SPR broadcast in Sheffield during the CND conference
on 2nd to 4th Dec. 1983 with a range of well
progrB11111les on peace i ssues and actio ns . But the CND
hierarchy were host il e, refusing to endorse or adv er tise
SPR (this was the 1st and la st pirate at a CND
Conference ). However the broadcast itself was a great
success, partly because of a cock-up by th e DTI and
police, who persuaded Sheffield's commercial station
Radio Hallam to close down temporarily to aid them
in tracking SPR on an adjacent frequency. In the end
they didn 't catch SPR, and when Radio Hal lam closed
everyone retu ned to SPR. Lots of good publicity.
Encouraged by this a new, non party collective
began broadcasting as SPR on Sunday evenings, starting
in Feb 84. It consisted of music, news features
and interv iews on themes like the Miners Strike, t he
anarchist Stop The City demos, the Campaign against
the Polic e . Bill, Legalise Cannabis, anti nuclear and
peace stuff, and not f orgetting anim al ri ghts. The
group deve iope d quickly in to a genuine radical local
alternative station and received lots of encouraging
interest and feedback. They also produced th e
booklet 'Sound Advice', advocating THAT MORE PEOPLE
DO THE SAME THING. SPR •,1as also active in t he Fr ee
The Airw aves Campaign and friends with Rebel Radi o
in Bristol, Radio Pleb and Our Radio in London, and
the short liv ed a.narchist Radio Revenge in Leeds .
However on 20th May 84 the police and DTI followed
the bus th~y took to their transmission site (a field)
and nicked all four of the SPR team and all the
gear. Though fines were lo w (less than £1001 I ' think.
and spirits remained · high, SPR stay ed off th

due mainly to lac k of transmitters or th <U,il 1 ty

Community Radio Experiment
The recent programme for experimental lco'1fflunity
Radio in this coun try began, not because of rcainpaigning
by th e liberal lefty C011111unity Radio Association,
or due to pressure from p i rate s, but because Peter
Stremes and the Adam S111ith Institute put ! t9gether
a report on CR which was accepted by Leo~ Btittan,
then head of'the Home Office. The idea was tQ get Radio
Jackie an open licence. People wer e then invited
to app ly for 21 local licences (for the whole country
) and a Home Office Panel was set up to pick the winners.
But the panel inclu ded members of the Community
Radio Ass. (CRA). All kinds of problems arose. and
the decision was delayed again and again, whle several
hundreds of groups applied. Radio Jackie 'stopped
broadcasting (along with some othe rs) to ,3id their
application. after a symbolic bust. There weite more
problem~. which ethnic stat ion to choose? Hdw to weed
out lefty infiltrators? etc. With this CR carrot
the new 1984 anti-pirate laws were being brought in .
But the main problem was that the brief give n ,by t he
Home Office panel obviously EXCLUDED commeroi a i statio
ns like Jackie and Horizon. When Pet er Stpemes and
co realised this (they'd put in an extravagant bid
reckoning they'd make £72.000 a year!) they determined
to wreck the who le scheme. It was 2 rears too
late to ,stop the scheme, but they did it, pr obably
by getting their contacts in the CIA and MIS to make
false repo rts to the Home Office that ther applicant s
were all lefty infiltrato rs trying to subvei::-t the
Tory controlled medi a. But more than that th~y persu aded
the Government of the obvious truth. ; tha t the
whole idea of CR (open access and non cojllmercial,
if tightly controlled) was the opposite of Tory philosophy.
Among t he hundreds of applicants were a coup le
used to scare the government off .. A BLACK ( horrors)
stat ion. JBC. supported by 'loony left' · Brent
Council. and an open access statio n ,Spectrum, sup ported
by 'The Peoples Republic of Islington 't ·

that the whole CR e xp erime nt was being scrapped bef ore
it had even begun. as Clement Freud of the Lib erals

is afraid of the voi ces of ordinary citizens; · that
its alright for Mr Murdoch to take over t~e !Time s.
but too dangerous to a 11 ow 21 community s tf t i lons to

the scrapping of CR is no surprise to us .
I
After the Axe
Our first re actio n to the axing of CR was joy and
hope. Maybe the 100' s of applicants would now get
transmitters and go on air. giv i ng the OTI and police
an impossible job. The answer to this was a loud
NO. Few of the applicants had any real inte rest or
committm ent and were pacified when the Home Office
agreed to compensate them for their wasted time and
money . The CRA, as the only recognised lobby group
threatened its members that if they wen t pirate they
would NEVER get a licence (t he old 'w ait till Labour
gets in' trick). There were a few token protests and
once ads on LBC radio were jammed, a group called
Ancor briefly threate ned to start an open access pirate
and broadcast everyones tapes, but stopped after
threats fro m the CRA.
Meanwhile Peter Stremes and his mates set about
rectifying the.ir blunder . In Oct 86. at a meeting
of the p i ssed off CR appli ca n ts, a new pressure group
was set up .. the Assoc. for Broadcasting Development.
to represent the lobby for legalising co1M1ercial right
wing pirates, on the US model, wit h a toke n 'community'
input: If the CR experiment is ever revived
by a Tory Government it will be the likes of the new
ABO ( and NOT the CRA) who will be vetting the applications.
If set up by a Labour Government the original
scheme will certainly go ahead. The same old shit

RADIO WAPPING 50 watts Mobile?
Radio Wapping kept up regular broadcasts, on top of
LBC, in North London, throughout June 86. These
took place at various times, though usually in the
morning on Saturday or Sunday.

Free The Airwaves is still going strong, as an
infor exchange and promotion group for radical
local pirates. In this book we reprint their 5w
transmitter design and add their new amplifier
which takes it up to 25watts. (This amp. can be
tuned for less power and used to feed the amp.
design taking you up to 80Watts). Any technical

the FTA bulletin, and will carry full technical
updates on these designs, and much more. To
join FTA and receive the bulletin send £2 (for
organisations: £10) to the address above.
YOU AND THE HIT SQUADS
The idea of a community /neighbourhood Radio
Station as part of a countrywide network has never
been properly explored. In purely practical terms the
viability of Free Radio has always been hampered by
the activities of the 'Hit Squad' of the Dept. of Trade
and Industry (The Radio Investigation Service). Stations
able to afford highly sophisticated gear like a
studio to transmitter microwave link have found
themselves with court cases to be proud of and been
put off the air with the confiscation of their gear.
Few involved in 'propagandist' radio can afford such
losses.
Low powered radio transmitters are cheap to replace(
around £35 for a 4 watt one) but the most
important factor for such stations to survive is to
have the protection of the community they serve -
safe houses and flats to disappear into, guaranteed
escape routes and refusal to co-operate with the R.I.S
would make such a station hard to put off the air.
London could support 480 such stations operating
over 1 ½ square miles, which would in itself make
enforcement impossible. In Japan the manufacture
of small FM transmitters (just a third of a mile range)
has produced over 700 stations in Tokyo alone.
Normal , 'big' radio has produced only one way communication
to a false community invented simply
by the act of broadcasting.
A small number of high powered transmitters
means a greater filtering of input into the station as
pr essure on airtime grows and necessarily makes it
more remote from the peopl e who are supposed to be
providing the programming. The only peopl e who
benefit from this are already organised pressure
groups. Anyone with any pretensions to breaking
down the mystification round transmitter and programme
construction and providing a medium open to
all is deluding themselves if they see high powered
transmitters actually providing an 'alternative' voice,
unless its the spurious 'alternative' of hip capitalism ..
no matter how good the intentions, accounting inevitably
becomes more important than content.
This is not to say that the use of high powered
transmitters should be ruled out. Radio communication
has the advantage of being nearly instantaneous,
virtually tamper free and best of all, its possible to
broadcast into areas the state would never allow left
propaganda to go. In situations like strikes, occupations
and evictions radio is unique in its ability to pull
people together in mutual aid and defence. Pirate

'
radio in ~he service of left wing causes has still enough
novelty value to attract an audience, and unlike other
forms of 'propaganda by deed' its more likely to win
the sympathy and even the involvem ent of the unaligned
j I
The !main contention is that this kind of broadca sting
P.3t¥o be on a 'hit and run' basis if its to have
any ch!-1f:ceo f survival .

anarchist/squatters news section of a progr e called The Message, which used to go out across London on the

in fact today is his birthday , yes its the Duke of Westminster,
howdy baby, who owns 15,000 acres in Cheshire,
11,000 in Wales, 100,000 in Scotland 900 in Shropshire
and thafs just for starters. He has an estate in Fermanagh,
shopping centres in Vancouver, a land development in Hawaii,
a 10,000 acre sheep farm in Australia and 300 acres of
Mayfair and Belgravia back home. This last little plot alone
is worth a cool billion quid, , making it probably the biggest
stash in Europe. He's in his twenties and terribly camera
shy. We're sorry we can't find his phone number, but he's
definitely our TOP OF THE SHITS.

And now listeners for some sad and serious news that has

the Soviet Working Class
We are sorry to report the arrest last summer of the mathematician
Valery Senderov, a member of the Soviet Free Trade
Union, -SMOT, on a serious charge of preparing and distributing
SMOTS underground info bulletin. He is still in prison.
Also arrested is Natalia Lazaereva, for her activities in the
unofficial womens movement. She has been charged with
anti-Soviet agaita tion and -propaganda
Still in the Soviet Union, and Big Brother is here too. We
report that the Soviet Press has recently been honouring the
50th anniversary of the death of a Young Communist informer,
Pavlik Morozov, who effectively killed his own father by
denouncing him in the purges of 1932 . Pavlik was then killed
by his grandfather and cousin in revenge and then they too
were shot. Pavlik was then built up as a Stalinist hero, laud e-

The Italian Explosion
It all happened in Italy after 1975, when hund reds
of FM political pirates (left wing) took to the air.
"The idealism of that first hour, when we thought we
had found THE medium of communication .. by and
for the masses". Roun d the clock discussions were
the ord er of the day, as literally everyone seemed to
be on the airwaves ! There were 'autonomists',house
wives, anarch ists, squatters, workers, womens groups,
intellect uals, marxists, etc, all clamouring to get their
views across. Everyo ne spoke and sang and put out
an incedib le range of programmes. It was a revolution
on the air waves. "We did it for contra-information,
against the media and the monopoly of the

what went wrong in the end? Or was it just the 'live
fast die young syndrome' at work?".
In 1975 there were sudde nly hundreds of such
stations in Italy . But by 1980 there were only l0's,
and by 1985 probably not one.
The first repres sion of 76 to 77 was quite severe,
but the pirates just kept coming back on air and had

or so it seemed, as the RAI (State media body) was

But this soon proved to be a curse in disguise,
as sw of commercial pirates began taking to the

and hig powered transmitters literally blotted us
off the airwaves, one by one . A prime examp le of
"free" c pitalism destroying the creativity and collectivity
f the people. By the end of 197 7 , as th eir

The big commercials brought back uniformi ty

raise th ir advertising profits they formed into

Netherlands
Pirate radio here began back in 1974, wit
sea pirates like Radio Veronica, followed b a wave
of successful land based Medium Wave p' ates. In
1979 the police were prevented from seizing M transmitter
of Radio Paloma by l00's of outrag d ~isteners.
,
The first FM pirates appeared around 1 80, and
the growth of the autonomous squatters ovement
after 1979 led to the first wave of Action tations.
The Vrij (Free) Keizer Radio was named ter the
huge squatted complex in the Keizers acht in
Amsterdam centre, where it broadcast fr m, and
which proved impossible to evict . Other cif the
Action Stations still broadcasting today e Radio
Rataplan and Radio Vrij Den Bosch. Thes stations
broadcast mainly squatters and resistance ews and
music, and went live during big demos and ·ots. The
police mainly tolerated them, , except du · g demos
etc when the re were some heavy confrontati ns.
The Vrije Keizer was the main alterna ive pirate,
dividing up its wavelength to allow wome groups,
local sq uat groups, anarchists,ethnic grou s etc to
do their own radio, but many other stati ns followed
in other cities and towns (eg. Stadjs Radio,
Oran.ie, Zwarte @ , etc.) Many of these o longer
exist, partly due to the relative decline of t e bovement
after 1983, and partly due to police r ids. Also
the format of such stations has changed, "th more
13.
stress on sub- and anti- culture, and less on direct
action (but this may change again). Neverth eless
some excellent pirates, including the Vrije Keizer,
and also Radio Rataplan and Vrij Den Bosch survive
as brilliant examples to the rest of the world.
The number of commercial FM pirates exploded
after 1980, with estimates of 6 to 10 thousand (Insiders
say 10 to 20 thousand) pirates totally overwhelming
the authorities. But this does not seem to have
'blotted out' any of the Action Stations, as happened
in Italy (perhaps this has some relation to the flat
ground?). Each year about 3500 pirates are raided,
and there has been heavier repression since the start
of 1985, but it still fails to stop them. There is a
State plan to open up Cable Radio, in 86/87 as a
means to divide and rule the pirates.
At the end of 1985 there was a youth conference
in Amsterdam for pirates from around Europe. At
the same time a new station. Factum FM had opened
up, and also the 'Radio Cafe Marconi' which was
a development of 'open Microphone programmes ,
with the aim of direct participation.
By 1986 times were changing, though the squatters
were being slowly defeated the struggle had
broadened a lot, with a whole range of Direct Action
groups attacking sexism, racism, militarism, nuclear
power,apartheid, pollution etc, giving the pirates
plenty to report. In 198 4 Radio Got had developed
a wild new style, starting from the Vrij Keizer 'stable'
it soon distanced itself from the Movement to take in
a wider audience. Activists saw Got as a trendy
sellout, while the producers claimed they included
all the action news, while adding their own music
programmes. And they did bro adcast live from
mass squat centre of Wyers, during the struggle to
evict and demolish it for a Holiday Inn. Got died
soon after, and some of her crew went into legal
stations, as predicted, while others joined Factum
FM, to make radical news and documentaries, as well
as drama, experimental music and open access programmes.

V rije Keizer Radio
The Vrije Keizer Radio (VKR) was born of the
Amsterdam squatters movement, and has stayed a
part of it ever since , reflecting the breadth and creat ivity,
as well as the internal contradictions of that
movement . It began at the end of 1979, broadcasting
from six heavily barricaded squats, known as
the Grote Kf'~:er, in central Amsterdam. After the
victory of tne Vondelstraat Riots in Feb. 1980
the Grote Ke1z~r became a symbol of freedom and
a big proble for the State. VKR began as a small
local FM pir ... ,_ at the beginning of the FM pirate
boom, and broadcast on l0lmhz th roughout the
gigantic 'Q ueens Day Uprising of April 30th,1980.
The Grote Keizer could not be evicted, instead the
Council bought the houses, and allowed the occupiers
to stay there .. on the condition that the Vrije Keizer
Radio should MOVE OUT! But this divide and rule
tactic turned out to be a blessing. VKR got itself
a bigger transm itter and started broadcasting for 2
hours each day from a squat in a differen t neighbourhood
(moving each day). This brought much
wider support and interest, and many different
groups came and went. For a long time the line-up
was Womens Radio (Vrouwenradio) on Tuesdays,
Anarchist Radio on Wednesdays, the Pijp area on
Thursdays, weekends from the Central area, etc.
The radio went on like this for years, basical ly
different groups sharing a transmitter and moving it
about, but it wasn't strong enough (or high enough)
to cover the while city, and interest wasn't that high,
exceptduring actions or evictions .
RIOT RADIO.
Whenever there were actions, riots or evictions
on a big scale everyone was suddenly tuning in to
the Vrije Keizer for the real news. For instance
during the Oct 82 'Lucky Luyk' evictions and
resistance the VKR went live throughout, with on
the spot interviews and instant information on
police movements. This could be don e through
reporters and phone-ins, as well as a direct phone
line we had with the 'Scanner Group'. This
Scanner group are basically radio 'buffs' who tune in
to the police radio (which is not on a public wave
band as it is in the UK) and follow them with computer
scanners. Important police communications are
now 'scram bled' but it wasn't long till the ScannerGroep
had their own de-scrambler. Activists carried
small radios with them , often with earphones under
their hoods, tuned to V KR, they often knew in advance
the exact movemen ts of the mass of riot police, and
could decide their own response in instant street

meet· g . In fact it got to the stage that, with all our
resou ce and people , we had a better picture of the
battle t an the police themselves, and they too were
tunin to VKR to find out what was going on!
D ri g that particular 'Lucky Luyk' eviction riot
the p li e made a major attack on the Tetterode
squat d buildings from where we were broadcasting,
but w i our list eners heard it reinforcements rushed
to th ea, and the police had to fight their way out,
only ind they had seized two transformers instead
of th tr nsmitter! Within an hour VKR was back on
the · , laying a crucial ro le in the struggle. There
have ee several other police attacks on VKR when
broad <l:asi ng 'riot radio' but up to now they have
never h tured a transmitter.
By 1 83 the weekend 'Central Amsterdam' group
(mainJly usic) wanted to split off, with the reason
that ~K was 'too unprofessional'. The solution was
to bui.Jd new transmitters, and keep the present one
as bac~rn . These were payed for by donations, gigs,
and tl1e ew 'Flux' squatters disco which had begun
in the jT ttero de. The weekend group became 'Rad io
Got' (G d) with a big new 200watt transmitter,
which 1th y shared for a time with the Vrouwenradio
( womtjns , while the Anarchists and the Pijp groups
shared l a 100watt rig. All the groups still used the
same ~5. mhz wavelength, and co-operated for evict ions,
~u otherwise not with Radio Got, who the
others I onsidered too trendy and becoming
The new transmitters covered the whole city, and
better 'ae ials and broadcast sites were also used. More
voluntee came forward and things got better, with
lots 0£ b · liant programmes, especially on squatting,
anti-m~lit · m, anti -nuclear ant i-sexist and third
W?rld s ggles, as well as many discussions, open
m1croppo e sessions and lots of record ings of live
bands. i KR also occasionally broadcast gigs or conferences
live from squatted buildings. By this time
progra ' es had become more structured with
regular n ws times , and background programme' s and
features.
VRIJE K IZER TELEVISION 1982 - 83.
In 1 te '82 a gang of TV pirates suddenly
appeared broadcasting through the cable television
networks (Amsterdam is all cable) They did it after
the reg channels had closed down, there was a
legal hit h in stopping them because the Cable
company s constitution said the cable had to be left
switched on. The TV pirates put out crappy mus ic,
advertisi g, music videos and lots of pretty gruesome
po . That is except for Vrije Keizer TV
(VKTV) which began tra nsmitt ing excellent
unshown videos on the squat movement, the German
move~en , the Womens Strike, the 3rd World, and
ads for quatters bars etc. This was the first ever

Radio Got who had become popular, had h ·r TX

old peopl e about their youthful experiences.
For a while a left wing Turkish group joined in
on Monday evenings, before getting their own station
together. But shortly afterwards the ir stat ion ( Halk
Der) had to close after heavy fascist attacks . VKR
itself then came under attack, after we made a prog ramme
anout the Turkish Fascists, the Grey Wolves,
and their "democratic" fronts, with the names of
those involved ( often getting Council grants! ) The
programme was jammed out twice by the fascists,
but went out the third time, starting a scandal. They
did not attack our transmitter site, which is a heavily
fortified squat with good escape routes.
In 1985 there were furthe r changes. Radio Twist
split off and Got died finally. Radio Factum began
their Radio Cafe Marconi. A new GrachtenRadio
(Centre) joined in, based on the big Frankrijk squat,
cafe and pub, and finally a -German group began Int ernationa

Due to regular meetings these diverse groups got on
OK for a while, but eventually Rabotnik, WHS and
Factum got together on l00mHz. By late 86 VKR
had actually closed down, but may now be back on

West Germany
"Radio must be changed from a means of distribution
to a means of communication"- wrote Bertold
Brecht in 1932, and it is as true today. In East Germany
the State has taken total control of the media,
while in the West an unholy alliance of State and big
business contrives to be nearly as authoritarian and
restrictive. Historically the German workers have
been among the first to practice free radio. During
the 1918 uprising and Revolution people took control
of radio stat ions and illegal radio broadcasts
(ArbeiterRadioBund) persisted throughout the
Weimar Republic.
Despite well organised and very serious efforts,
pirate radio has now been all but wiped out ( but for
one notable exception) in the whole of West Germany.
The Action Radios still exist, but have been reduced
to doing 10 minute programmes, with new
names every time. And unfortunat ely there aren't
enough 10 minute pirates on one wavelength to make
them worth listening out for. The repression of any
non conformist views, actions or even dress is now
very heavy, with the squat ters movement wiped out
completely and activists continual ly persecuted by
the computer controlled police force. It ta kes ten
minutes from when you switch on your transmitter
before a gang of riot police breaks down your door.
Hence the 10 minute pirates. Such pirates can also
occasionally be heard in the Eastern Bloc ( eg Radio
Solidarnos c) and in the USSR. The action stations are
always trying to reappear, for instance during big
demos (eg the broadcasts from moving cars during the
StartBahn West campaign against the new US airbase
at Frankfurt ). In Berlin, Radio Metropolis now broad -'.casts
from the Eastern Sect or, where the position is
slightly easier, and Radio Gaga still exists as far as we
In Z 'eh the womens radio, WELLENHEXEN
and SCH ARZ - KHATZE (black cat) still do some
broa<lct . The police are very quick to attack any
pirates ing the British pretext of 'causin g radio
interfe en e'. Radio 24, the huge commercial pirate
broadc t ng from Italy isnowclosed down. In Zurich
a gro~ f alternative radio buffs and ex pirates got
togeth r der the name LORA and got a legal freqency
o the Sta te when some were handed out in
1982. 3 licences were given from 230 applications,
to 31 mercial stations ... and LORA, as a 5 year
t. The irony is that only LORA is prospering,
d e to membership, donations, benefits and
volun er workers. Its quite a democratic station
and . e c urages listener participation. Different

story is an inspira ti on. It was begun way
977, by a coalition of French, Swiss and
Germa nti-nuclear activists, who broadcast across
the b rd rs from mountainous forest to France and
to the r iburg area of Germany.
R~di Dreyeckland began with a week ly dual
langu~e programme and the police and PTT (French)
had n I ck finding the transmitter, despite attempted

Frenc uthorities and the sta tion split into five

doing 2 ours a day, and then jumped to 6 hours a
day, i h broad casts from France beamed to a
moun · /for est tran smitter and re-dir ect ed into
Germ . The original anti -nuke pirate was also st ill
going tr ng.
T e daily news programmes deal in subjects
like t e environm ent, 3rd World, gays, pr ison ers,
ethnic minorities and the independent mu c cene.
By this time Radio Dreyeckland had muc apport

no state, party or commercial backing of n kind
and is all volunteer, except for a few office w~rkers.
The French part is now legalised, but in Ger a y you
can't even apply for legalisation! However in 1985
the German State put out feelers about lirnsing
some commercial stations. Radio Dreyeckl responded
by coming down from the mount ·n and
attempting to broadcast in Freiburg itself! ,
On 20th April 85 Radio Dreyeckland
broadcast in Freiburg, from a studio ope

who can make programmes on the same basis as the

had tried a pirate station, a year earlier, but it was
raided and sunk by the police within 48 hours. Now
as long as they can say what they like, they don't
mind being legal. There is some frustration, however,
for instance an anarchist radio worker was put in jail
in Aarhus for advocating an action on the air.
France • Political Bat
The pirate explosion in France in the late 70's
was heavily repressed by the right wing regime led by
Giscard D'Es taing, and there were a long series of
busts, seizures and arrests . In France the battle was ~
intense from the start, with many thousands of ·
peop le involved in Free Radio (partly due to heavy
political control of the 'straigpt' media) and the ~ . ~\ ~ovL;,
State taki ng the 'danger' very seriously.
The first to transmi t regularily was Radio Verte
in 1977, soon followed by stations like Radio Lorr- *
aine of the Longwy steelworkers and Rad io Verte .

Kanak~, gays, etc. But it was the style of Radio
Mouv ce that made it so different .. "it is a dazzling

the re), d the licensing process has everything to
do wit romoting business and becoming commercial.
F r example 15 of the 22 legalised stations
have e dy been bought and sold again, even that of
the 'ra i al' newspaper Liberation".
In the run-up to the May 1981 General Election
the continued repression of the pirates became an
election issue, with the ascendant socialists supporting
legalisation, and even setting up Radio Riposte,
their own pira te, which of course got legalised when
they won. After May '81 there was a huge explosion
of cultural, music and political pirates all over France,
with seeming 'carte blanche' from the new Socialist
Government. But the State moved quickly to control
the situation. From 1982 a number of 'Radio Projects'
were indeed legalised, along with some of the
Free Radios, but those favoured were the big commercial
pirates, with their uniform music and style,
while the State tried to keep a monopoly on the
'serious' radio listeners. It became very difficult for
the smaller militant radio pirates to survive and fight
off the superior power (in watts and mon ey) of these
commercial and State stations. There were by now
several Federations, the FNRL with 300 stations
wanted to remain non-commercial, with 'civic participation'.
Repression began again, gradually, against
the smaller militant stations who cou ldn't or didn't
want licences, but also against the wave of unlicensed
commercial pirate s. The government was hosti le to
an 'Americanisat ion' of the airwaves, and took not e
of what had happened in Italy. This worked in favour
of the militant anti-commercial Free Radios, tho ugh
some left/cultural pirates also wanted to sell advertising.
One major success story is that of Radio Libert aire,
the station of the French anarch ist federation,
which was raided , legalised, banned, raided and is
now tolerated with an extensive listenership. (See
next section).
Another from this stable is Radio Mouvance,
which was started by an Anarcho-Syndicalist from
Radio Libertaire in March '83 as a very radical 'youth
experimental' station with open access to a range of
left wing and minority groups and campaigns. Radio
Mouvance refused to even consider legalisation, and
began to broadcast 24 hours a day on an anti-racist.
anti-fascist, anti-imperialist basis. It soon became a
platform for many extreme left groups as well as
anarchis ts, foreign workers, prisoners, 3rd World
independenc e fighters (like the PLO and militant

months that were to follow: heated, rythmi , , intim ate
and full of surprises!

Laurent: Durin g a Jun e broadcast Leo Ferre ( an anarchist
who is also the most popular singer /songwriter
in Fran ce) had proclaimed "You can count on me if
things get rough and you're put off air" . And further more
l000's of listeners were saying "We are with
you". This mass support in July '83 hadn't come by
the flick of a magic wand. Friendships and politi cal
alliances had been forming on a daily basis since our
first broadcast in Sept. '81. Through Radio Libertaire
(mainly) the idea of "an anarchist milieu" had come
back after a long absence, allowing us to escape from
the "folkloric marginali ty" the media and politicians
had relegated us to. Radio Libertaire reached l000 's
of people. A minority were anar chis ts, libertarian s
and sympathisers, but the vast majority weren't in any
broad agreement with our politics. Yet everyone had
got a strong atta chmen t to the station, and this was
clear as early as summer '82 when the 'List of Authorised
Stations' was announced without Radio Libert aire
on it. With th is support we were already facing
up to our old enemy, the State , in confident mood.
The holiday season was however a big drawback, as a
big proport ion of our listeners were away from
Paris.
Magazine Libertaire: How did the summer's events
unfold?
Laur ent: It started with a long period of waiting.
Radio Libertaire proposed a 'common front' of all
the Free Radios, but unfortunately there was no lack
of manipulations, provocations and attampts at recu peration
( even the rightwing paper Le Figaro was
doing somersaults, waxing lyrical about 'justice and
freedom for the Free Radios') . We steered well clear
of this type of activity, and our stubborn determination
was to be seen far away from the backrooms
where the government and Free Radio representat ives
were plotting ... the liquidation of the Free Radios
themselves! Our attitude gained us respect and we
became an importan t example to the rest. On 1 7th
Aug., just as it was being suggested that the government
might back down, 'Carbone 14' was busted off
the air, sending a shock through the FM pirates .
Radio Libertaire acted immediately against the
"vandalism of the Carbone 14 studios". But another
station 'Frequence Gaie' were quick to begin broad casting
on the same frequency, now allocated to them,
and so shattering the so-called unity of the Free
Radios.
At 6.00am on 20th August six more stations were
raided by the CRS (French paramilitary police).
These were 'Lumiere l0l'(fundamentalist catholic),
'Made In Italy', 'La Voix du Cedre (Lebanese pirate),
'Radio Tiers Monde' (3rd World) who had all their
gear smashed, and 'Radi o Arabe Paris'.
That evening Filioud announced that 'the radio
waveband is saturated, when a plane has 146 seats
there's no room for 60 extra passengers' ....
Magazine Libertaire: In this tense situati on , what was
the mood at Radio Libertaire?
Laurent: Tragic , cos we knew the seizure of our equipment
was imminent, but our mood was fantastic. All
of us there and the listeners and the militants of the
Federation Anarchiste were prepared to fight to protect
our station. We had no idea when they'd come so
;;everal teams were set up to patrol the area and to
warn us by CB's if the police were coming. The studio
was barricaded and we stayed on air 24 hours a day.
The phones were ringing day and night with support
calls. The government was mistaken if they thought
the holidays would stop our support. We wait ed, hot
md tense, till 6.40 am on Sunday August 28th .. A
militant had spo tted police and the informa tion was
put on the air immediately. But by the time we could
say they were definitely com.ing for us it was too late
for supporters to get in. The police quickly cordoned
off the surrou nding area. The door was broken down
by the CRS, those present were being beaten and
kicked , and the aerial was cut .But we had got a phone
call through to the pirate 'lei Et Maintenant' (Here &
Now), who began broadcasting news of the raid. Listeners
and anarchists were already arriving, despite the
early hour, but couldn't get through the CRS police
lines . Further away militants in cars were be ing
stopped by plainclothes cops pointing guns in their
windows! Some Radio Libert aire listeners were beaten
up as they were forced to watch the painful spect acle
withou t being able to help . Technicians cut down
the aerial, the equipment was loaded into a truck and
driven away, and all those present in the studios were
hauled off to the police stat ion.

Atld hat was that . Worse than the expected silence

T~er was no question of giving in. The raids were

There are two federations, Free The Airw ve~ is the

a deep gap between the Flemish (dutch spe ki*g) and
French speaking communities, and this is r~flected
among the pirates . In addition the 'straig ' ~elgian

Europe (a CIA channe l) made use of a Belgian pirate.
So there's a deep division between the 'rad ios Libres'
and the co~mercial pirates. In addition, in the
French speakmg areas commercials aren't allowed on
any channel. Its all a bit confusing.
One of the least commercial and oldest of the
FM pirates in Flanders is Radio Toes tel in Ghent.Its
half financed by benefits and donations and has a
democratic structure with at least 80 volunteers. In
1985 Radio Toestel was given a whole frequency and
went legal, merging with Radio Central from Antwerpen.
In Brussels Radio Air Libre has now also been
legalised,desp ite its name its mainly an art and culture
station , though it does allow groups to make their
own programmes. It was with Radio Air Libre that
Chantal Paternos tre was working at the time of her
arres t and frame up for CCC bombings (see inside

pirates, some of which claim higher audiences than
RTE the State system, will face a crackdown. Typical
'divide and rule' tactics. There aren't really any alternative
music or politics statio ns on the air that we
know of. Surprisingly Sinn Fein haven't got a pirate
together , considering th ey're banned from speaking
on state radio or TV .. The Irish rep ublic has also been
a haven for international shor t-wave pirates.
The Rest of the W or].<l
Once you move outside Europe you're talking about
very different cultures and political situations, and
the experience of such pirates is not so relevant .
Radio is a part of the internati onal battleground,
the medium , for instance was used effectively both
by Hit ler 's fascists, who excelled at mass propaganda ,
and by the French and othe r resistance partisans.
Afte r the 2nd world war almost every conceivable
guerrilla and national libera tion movement had its
own 'pirate ' stations .. the Irgun, the IRA , Basque
seperatists , Kurdish rebels, Spanish or anti-communist
exiles, etc ., etc. During the Cuban revolu tio n, for
instance, there were at least 9 stations battling it out ,
3 revolutionary and 6 run by the CIA and the Right.
The se includ ed the famous ' Radio Rebe lde' set up by
Central America
EL SALVADOR.,
A good example of a classic revolutionary / nationalist
pirate is Radio V enceremos in El Salvador ,
broadcasting from the liberated Marazan mountains
despite continuo us army and air force attacks by
the right wing US funded regime. Radio V enceremos
is the voice of the FMLN federation of guerrilla
movements and began regular broadcasts on Hlth
June 1981, after a year of sporadic 'people's revolutionary
radio' in the capital city. During the '82
'elections' the air force failed to bomb Radio Venceremos
off the air, and they had to be jammed out by
US vessels off sho re. The station gives a comp lete 1y
different world view to the State media, and is well
suppo rted by the poor and dispossessed (90% of the
people). Such radios are an essential part of building
and participating in a pre-revolutionary movement,
in this case one postponed indefinitely by US intervention
and the Death Squads campaigns. One danger
of such radio, is that it can perfo rce become cut off
from its supporters , and also lends itself too easily
to institutionalisation as the 'p arty radio' of the new
state after such a left nationalist revolution. Radio
Venceremos has tried nove l ways to gain audience

In the US everything is free if you have t he
mon ey. Radio and the media at large seem to be in
pr ivate commercial hands, though much of it is controlled
by huge corporations enmeshed in the State
and the 'mil itary industrial comp lex'.
So, its free to go on the airwaves, but: 1) It t akes
years to go through the licence procedures of the
controlling body, the FCC. 2) It costs many l000's
of dollars. 3) To get such a licence you need to be
a 'r espectab le hierarchically organised group' .With
Boards of Directors , etc. 4) What they give, they can
take away, if you dict by some miracle get a noncommercial
licence they would stop it at the first
wrong move.

Canada has a fairly liberal radio system and few
if any pirates. In Quebec 'Community Radio' is a
legal alternative, and in some places is the main local
station. This idea is also strong in Vancouver.

How To Be This sectio n tells you exa ctly how to go abou t
setting up your own radio pirate, with _all the tips
learned from bitter experience. First of all here's a
list of the main trungs you will need. So you ,vant to
be a rad io p irate? ... Read On.
A Radio Pirate
What You'll Need
A. A group of committed peop le who get on with
each other and have plenty of time and energy.
B. A programme, presuming you have someth ing
wort h saying or playing. You don't even need a
stu dio to start off with . Just borrow som eon e's
stereo and a microphone and start making practice
record in gs onto good qual ity cassette tape s.
C. A Transmi tte r. Ideally over 10 watt power , bu t
5, watt is fine for local broadcasts,o r when using an
aerial with 'gain' .(see Techn ical section) . You can't
buy one over the counter in Britain, but here are
some alte rn at ives:
1) Buy one from another pir ate (beware of rip-offs).
ll)Buy one over the counte r abroad (see Contacts) .
In Italy fo r inst ance you can get a high quality 50W
transmitter over the counter for £200. You can buy
kits in Belgiu m, France ,Netherlands,USA, etc . You
then have to smu ggle it home .
lll)Buil d your own.A hobby ist can build a low
power FM transmi tter from the instructions in this
book. You7:lll17Idd-on71mplifurrs- late, if youneed

VHF: Pros and Cons
First let.s deal with FM (F requency Modulated
broadcasting , which is your probable choice. The
advan tage s of FM are many . The transmitters are
small, light and quite cheap. Reception tends to be
either very clear or non existant. Its excellent for
music and fo'r rec ord ing off and can qui te easily be
adapted to transmi t in stereo (impossi ble with AM).
A major plus for the pirate is that its easy to hide
and t ransport the gear, aerials are comparitively
small and can be made collaps able. Its also possib le
to put it in a vehicle, even a bicycle, and go mobile,
albei t with a smaller and changing re ception area .
The average 5 to 20 watt transmitter would be in
a metal box not bigger than 12" by 6" by 3" in size ,
and weigh not more than 8 lbs with the rest of tbe
gear (but no t inclu ding the car battery.i f you're
using one) . The aerial is not on ly shorte r but more
effic ient and of course more pract ical than the long
and tric ky pro cedure for MW aerials. Also low power
FM tr ansmitters ('r igs') can be tuned to slight ly diff -
ham s or dissident enginee rs. Its almost essent ial to
have at least one person in your group with some
techn ical know how.
1 VJ Get one built to your specifications . There are
a few e lectronics engineers about who will build them
for a re asonable pric e. Obviously we can't pub lish
their names and addresses. If you write to the obvious
addresses on the Contacts Page we may be able to
give you a box number to contact .
D. Ante nna (aerial). You can adapt a design yo urself
from an antenna book ( eg. The 2 ~letre Ante nna
Handbook :Babani or Tabs book s. or an ama teur
Radio h andbo ok). Or use one o f our re ady made
designs (see Tech. Section). Look ou t for aluminium
tu bing or struts (on skips) which make good building
materi al.
E. Odds and ends. You'll need basic tools (also look
out for soldering iro n ,multimeter,SWR meter) ,a
cheap cassette deck, probably one or two good car
batterie s, a roll of co-ax ca ble for the aerial, a ra dio to
listen in on , etc. Also start collecting and reading
Amateur Radio Handbooks and an relevant writin.gi

erent frequencies , on MW you're stu ck on one, unl ess
you get a new crys tal.
The disadvantage is that VHF -ni is essentially
a 'line of sight' co mmunica tion ... \Vh.ich means that
your re cept ion area de pends cruc ially on the height
of yo ur aerial above large blocking objects. This is no
proble m if you can get up on a hill , or a tower block
but it does resti ict the choice of broadcasting sites,
mak ing you easier to find and trap . \\"ith local broad casting
you have more choice of sites. In very hilly
areas, unless you can get up on a mountain, you'd
better choose MW, also if you want to broadcast to
scattered communities over a wide area . Distance
covered with an FM rig depe nds as much on height
as on power. A 40 watt rig on a 15 story tower block
should cover a 15 mile radius if the re are no blocki ng
hills. A 4 watt rig shou ld go 5 miles from the same
height,but if you build a directional aerial "'ith 'gain'
you can multiply that power many tim es . You don't
r eally need a big expens ive and ha~d to build transm -
itter. Also don 't assume a 100w rig is ten tin1es as
po werful as a 10w oneJt doesn't work like that.
To sum up , FM broadcas ting is the ideal for the
guerrilla or commun ity pirate, cheap ,mobile and
adapta ble . Another advantage is th at there's loads
-~---- -
of room on the FM broadcasL band ,its lite rally half
empty ,and there will be more when the police eventu:

drills'. Best place for the aerial is a high,easily climb able
tree. If its 11ot too obvious leave it up there and
have a spare ready. An added problem with hills is
that you normally have to lug at least one car battery
about, which is terrible i1 you have to climb fences,
ditches,etc at night (wear gloves and old clothes
against acid spills ),something like a pram or shopping
trolley can help. You can't leave the batteries on site
as they need re-charging for your next broadcast .So
mains elec tic is a big help if you can run a lead from
somewhere. Outdoors all your gearmust be in waterproof
cases, or covered with a tent or tarp . Tents are
good if you can pretend to be camping. Talce care
also of yourself and your group (you need at least

OTHER POSSIBLE BROADCASTING SITES
FESTIVALS, especially large free festivals are an
exce llent and common broadcas t sit . A small 4w rig
will do fine. Set up on high ground in a tent or
vehicle. and invite the festival goers to protect you
from possible police attack .much more unlike ly
.9]
SlT -INS and protest occupations (eg.Greenpeace) are
another good possibili ty ,which we don't thin k has
been tried. Especially occupations of high towers,
build ings or pylons for public ity. But in this situation
capt ,ure is pretty certain, therefo re a small disposable
transmi tte r would be ideal. A good strategy is for
everyo ne to deny using it,and to use any following
trial for more publi city ,eg. on the lines that the
army etc and police are already hogging most of the
ainvaves .
'NO GO AR~AS' are a step up from occup ied
factories . We know for instance that nationalist
pirates broadcast from Free Derry and parts of West
Belfast when they were 'no go areas' to the state . Of
course there are now no true '110 go areas' in Britain,
but there are plenty of inner city estates where the
police rarely venture .especially in che evenings in
the riot season,for fear of 'concrete rain ' or worse
from the roofs. A high block in such an area could
be an excellent site , espcially if you can tip off the
loc al you th to lend a hand . Whenever major rioting
begins large areas are suddenly devo id of police ,till
they can group in numbers and re-take the area.
This is another opportun ity for 'on the ball' local
pira tes . By monitoring po lice radio. runners , and

if not attached/ cheap cassette deck plus mains lead
or 2 clip ons and 6 volt bike battery / charged up car

the co-axial cable ( with plug attached and clips or
attached to aerial / fused plug board (if on mains)/
programme tapes (rewound to starting position) /
small FM radio receiver{s) to monitor broadcasts/
CB's for lookouts,fairly essential,( £ 10 licence fee
optional) /plasti c 'gaffer tape' /soldering iron and
solder in case of broken leads /t orch / warm clothes/
munchies I bus fare/ .
ON THE WAY
Ideally you need four people . at least two. Carry
the gear as inconsp icuously as possible, in holdalls or
plakky bags. The antenna is a problem . If its a big
long one make it collapsable,using butte rfly nuts
in assemb ly. Or try to keep it somewhere close to
tile site. On arr ival at the site, especially if you've
used it before , send an emptyhanded scout ahead . to
be sure the police and DTI aren't waiting for you and
all is clear. Check also you 're not followed.
SETTING VP
In the case of a tower block . You shoul d have
been the re beforehand. and have eithe r a key or a
broken Jock. to get straight onto the roof. Lock the
door qui etly behind you . If U1ere's two do ors onto
the roof have access through bo th. Take your gear to
the lift/ heating room and find a plug in wall socket
foot , and should be good quality and well insulated.
Your lookouts should already be on station,with
torches or CBs, one at the foot of the tower (prefe rably
sitting in a car or flat) and one on the roof . Keep
low and quiet and wear soft shoes (In one court case
Eric Gotts (head of the DTI sq uads) claimed he recog -
nised an Our Radio member from the ground, 18
stories up,at night.The judge accepte d his word .)
When the antenna is up securely, lead the co,ax
back and pl ug or screw in to the back of your t rans mitter
. Now plug in the TX to the cassette deck (TX~

avoid interfe rence . Keep the din lead well away from
the power leads. Interference between :eads can often
cause loss of power and/or "Sprogs" (unwanted
signals on the wrong frequency).You can go so far as
to block leads from each other with l'>ricks.
Plug in the cassette deck and the TX to your plug
board (or connect to batteries) and switch on . If you
have that facility just switch on the •,exciter' stage of
the TX first for testing , no need to alert .Big .Brother
premature ly. Go to the other end of the roof with
your radio rec eiver and tune in. Then adjust the modulation
on you r TX, in relation to other channels , to
get the best sound. If thats OK but there is unusual
knocking or crac kling sounds try moving the cassette
deck further from the TX,or raise it above gro und if
possibl e . Try further separating or screening the
power lines from the din lead .
You may well find that you have sprogs (hannon ics
or spurious signal~) all over the waveband.Check
for this. ff so check reception with your loo kout
100 yards away , normally such sprogs disappear by
that distance and you're OK. But if your signal is
still spread all over further a.way switch off and clear
off. Your TX is fucked up and needs difficult repair
or tuning you can't do on site . If you find you 're
interfering ,vith fire,ambulance or pigs, stop, before
they come after you. Most pirates are very careful not
to do this.
When all checks out OK, insert your programme
tape, switch off, and wait for the agreed time to begin.
With practice you can easily set it all up and test it
in 10 minutes, but its good to allow a half hour and
to be methodical and coo l. Never,for instance,switch
on your TX without the antenna attached,you'll blow
it. The amp stage of your TX should get qu.ite hot
when drawing power, if not its not working. With
bigger trans mitters you may need also a small electric
fan to cool the heatsinks on the power transistors.
Once you're -on air its good to go and phone friends
for recep t ion re ports furt her afield.

PRECA UTIONS
Don't talk or boast unnecessarily about you r sites
or stud io . Work on a 'need to know' basis from the
start . One method is to keep programme makers
seperate from your broadcasting team .. tapes can even
be delivered to a 'dead letter drop' for instance. But
if you can really trust each other its better if everyone
takes a turn at broadcasting, otherwise the

D) DISAPPEARING
When the DTI are really on your tail one thing
you can do is take a weeks rest, then come back
with a diffe rent name ,style and tim ing. Of course
this fucks up to"tally your efforts to make a name for
yourselves and gain a regular audience, but at least
you're still on air, with maybe a few months grace
befo re they start after you again . Also change your
frequency and voices on tape if possible .
.E) SWITCHING
In theory this is a good system, but you need a
big team, your own transport, and two or three
transmitters (on the exact same wavelength). The
idea is this , .. as the police and DTI close in on one
location, the signal switches to a second site. Either
you 're using links, or hav<!copies of the programme
tapes. The team at the first site evades the police and
sets ofi for a 3rd site and sets up. If they go forth e
2nd site you switch to the 3rd site and carry on,etc.
When combined with Cat and Mouse tactics this can
mal<e you di!ficult to stop. The problems are, if
you 're using tower blocks your choices are limited ..
If you set up say 5 miles away your reception area
may be completely dif ferent, and you'll need plenty
of dedicated people ready to wait night after night
to play games with the police .. And when they
become determined they will still get you . We know
of one South London pirate. who used switching
with apparen t success, then one night all 3 of their
transmitters were seized within 15 minutes!
Switching would work better when combined and
varied with olber methods of gening away with it.
Particularily if you 're doing a local station, where you
don't need so much height . and have lots more choice
of broad casting sites.
ins on FM. which may have been used by Radio
Arthur. This is to use the VVHF microwave
transmitte r, beaming your signal at the microwave
dish recieving the signals of a legal station from their
studio's . The ir dish then picks up your signal, and
providing you 're close enough to be stro nger than
their signal, you get re-broadcast by their main
transmitte r, thus giving your break-in perfect coverage
throughout their recep tion area.
However, we don't have technical plans to build
such tricky VVHF t ransmitters. and it would be
quite expensive. Thou gh this type of break -in is
possible at present. (To stop you fast, they'd have
to switch off the entire station). They will probably
make it more diffic ult by using access codes to
receiver dishes, as is already done to avoid piracy of
satellite dishes. (Note: Don't play around witb
adapted cordless telep hone, or an 1"'M exciter on a
different freq_uoncy (or even over an ordinary phone
line.though sound quality suffers) . You also have to
make a small directional high gain antenna. If you're
using a low power link and a narrow beam its nigh
impossible for the DTI to trace yo u.and it was
assumed it was safe to link from the studio. But
recently studios using links have been raided,in a few
cases , with every bit of equipment, furniture, record
collection s etc etc seized unde r the 1984 laws (eg, a
raid on Radio Horizon 's studios in late 85 when over
.£20,000 worth of gear was 'st olen ' legally. This may
not however mean that the DTI's new gear can detect
links. Its just as easy to find your location by gossip,
pnone taps or just by following you. Links can make
you personally safe, if they can trace one you could
always use two, or th ree ... what they don't and can 't
do is pro tect your trans mit ter, its main advan tage is
tha t it allows you to go live from the studio . To
protect yourself you might as well use a time r ,to
switch the gear o!! and on remote ly. Timers are
pr etty easy to build , and you can buy kits, but good
ones arc hard to find 'off the she lf' as they can obviously
be used to make bombs. A good one to buy
is the plug in variety, used for fooling burglars when
you 're on holidays, or by landlords to deter squatters.
For remo te switch ing you can also make sound
activated switches, via a radio link , or 'square wave'
switches, via a phone line (see diagram in Tech Sect) ..
What none of these devices can do however is to
turn over a tape, so you still have to go to the site
to do this , unless you want to broadcast for less than
an ho ur .

CONFRONTATION
A good trick if you can get away with it. The OT!
ind police (they normally only bring a (ew) are
wide open to attack ( the mou;;e beco mes the
cat!) when coming to get you. The problem is th at
in future yo u'll have to change your statio n name,
frequency , even your radio voice and they'll always
be on your trall. The good thing IS that if pirates
start attacking them they have to bring many more
police with them. and can only do it when spare
po lice are availab le. Also they are always look ing
over their shoulders, and have co be more careful
with their surveillance work.
One easy way to hit back. on tower blocks .
Is ·to trap them in the lifts. The lookout signals up
when they' re in and you throw the main power
switches in the lift room. ( Careful you don't trap
residents as well). Then you take you r gear down the
the stairs . heatmg up any of them you meet on the
131.I
way, and make off. Their cars are also vulnerable,
usually they 're parked unguarded around the comer .
If you're going to attack themdirect.ly make sure
you 're well masked and tooled up and have enough
skill and numbers to get past them. Go straig ht for
the po lice officers and disable them befo re they
can make their 'o fficer in distress' call (take or
smash their radios. or have someo ne jamming theu
frequenc ies).
Other direct ways of hittin~ back are. attacking
the OT! at their oases, attacking their vehicles at
their depot, obt aining home addre sses/phone
numb ers of chief officers and harassing them, etc .etc ..
Remembe r, they have the entire state apparatus
backing them up, any form of direct attack should
therefore be anonymous and never spoken of or
boasted about later. or befo re hahahahahahahah:
When the looko ut signals a raid or anything
very suspicious (e .g. a cop car cr>1ising too close
too often) immediatelly switch off. dismantle the

are many advantages to broadcasting locally, eg.
more broadcast sites, harde r to get caught, room
for more pirates on the broadcast band, cheaper
easier to build transmi tters , closer contact and parti cipation
of listeners .etc, In a big city its a gt•od idea
for your station to base yourselves in one area.
whethe .r you're bro adcasting locally or citywide .You
need a local base, and local backing,financial if possible.
If your station is appealing to one small section
of listeners it may not however make sense to do a
local station, because the potential listeners are
fewer a local station should aim at a fairly wide
sect ion of the population. An open access station
would work well on a local basis.as coordination
would be easier. and all kinds of interest and minority
groups could be persuaded to make
programmes. On a local basis publlcity and suppor1
are much easier to get, as is the possib ility of mobilising
people to defend you when attacked .. eg. a
popular station in the middle of a large housing
estate . Local broadcasting in inner city areas can
nevertheless involve hundreds of t housands of
potential listeners. Most of the smaller existing
pirates are, in effect, local stations, because of the
limitations of height and the power of their transmitters,
though very few allow any access or see
themselves as a local voice and resource.
We're not talking here about commercial
pirat<:>s, where its Just a matter of having good
financial bac king, popular D.J .'s and hit reco rds,
plenty of adsjingles and news replayed from legal
statio ns .
We're talking about the 'do it yol.U'5el f'
co mmunity or political pira te, starting from square
one, and doing something worthw hile and original .
The truth is that most commercial pirates, in c!ieix
e ffort to offend nobody and build towards a
possible licence, practice heavy self censorship and
are often as boring,banal,repetitive,cap italist.sei.:ist
elitist and even as anti-democratic as the lei;:al ones ,
t)1ough there are a few exceptions .. Such pirates
are obsessed with keeping their technology secret
and attacking the 'compet ition at every opportunity
.
Smaller,non-commercial pirates are in a dillerent
situation.and can only survive and develop
by co-operation,with the eventual rum of breaki ng
the state and commercial monopoly of 'Her J.lajesty's
' airwaves.
YOURSELF,
First thing you need is an interest in sound,
and something worth saying or playing . Get a hold
of a mike and a cassette deck and play around with
it. Record yoursel f, record any and everythin g.
Listen and record off the radio, off TV. off
people's stereos, in the street. Play back ~·our

Note down your results and ideas and discus, t~em

You need to fmd more people with ;i.nilar

prepared to share in the tasks, risks and finances
equally ,according to their abilities (in pract ice th is
rarely happens). Hold regular meetings, just
keeping in touch can be a prob lem in big cit ies . Go

LOCAL / ''COMMUNltY" PIRATE RADIO
The word 'community' has lost any real mean ing,
through misuse and over-use ( eg 'Co mmunity

the past (if they ever really existed) except on the
Soap Operas, as the system breaks us all down into
individual consumers. So if you' re talking about
"Community Radio" you should be quite clear
what you mean by it , and what the State means

Medium Wave
Advantages and Problems .
At the moment FM bradcasting,wi th all its advan tages,
is the favourite for pirates . But its well worth
point ing out tha t at least 25% of radio receivers in
Britain can't even receive FM, so you can't pick up
most pirates on older radios , Another thing, in some
hilly areas FM broadcasts have a very bad coverage
area. And a third advantage, you can cover a very
much bigger area on MW, at least potent iaily . MW
can be th e best choice for you, especially if you're
in a country area, or in hills or mountains, or only
want to broadcast by day and aren' t too worried
about sow,d quali ty . MW transm itte rs are also fairly
cheap and easy to build, and because you use a
crystal there's no prob lem with tun ing or with
'sprogs' (harmonics). Though the antenna is a huge
length its just a roll of wire, and doesn't necessarily
have to be up high,which gives you a quite diffe rent,
if still limited, range of possible broadcasting sites.
MW wor ks by bounc ing radio waves back off the
stratosphere, not by line of sight like FM.
Of course there 's lots of other disadvantages ,
one is sound quality, and ste reo is out of the
ques tion , and there 's not much free space on the
wave band chiefly because of a host of.....E.uro.pean.
stations, w'hich become stronger at nigh t, blotting
out your r elat ively weak signal ( th is 1s due to atmospheric
change s we are told). The TX is also bigger
and hea vier (about 12"X8"X6 ") and you'll pro bably
need to use car batte ries .
One thing I forgot, if you want to reach any of
the 50,000 prisoners in Brit j ails.you must use MW,
FM is still banned in prison , for some typically petty
reason,
It is also agreed that you 're generally less likely
to get busted. In the present repressive climate th ats
well worth considering.
HOW TO BROADCAST ON MW (540 - 1600 Khz).
YOUR TRANSMITTER.
Enough general talk. So you want to broadca~t on
MW. So here's how to do it . First, your trans mitter .
Medium Wave transmitters aren't so hard to build,
any good amateur radio buff could do it, and there's
peop le around who will build them (reckon to spend
£100 to £150). The technology is trie d and test.ed
and our design (see Tech Section) is as good as any.
The TX is valve operated and you use a crys tal (which
you have to order on the chosen wave length) which

Section,especially Italy.)
It is a mistake and an exc use to blame the Tories
and the new draconian laws for the lack of alternative
pirates in Britain. The main thing stopping us is the
lack of any strong combatative movement ( whether
it be workers, womens, anarch ist, or whatever) in
which to build a big wave of new pirates, tho ugh
there are literally millions of sympathetic people
about .
keeps you on frequency without the prob lems of FM.
So you have to decide from the start which frequency
yo u 're going for and stick to it, or buy a new crystal.
When choosing your frequ ency remember that it
must be divisible by 9 .. MW frequencies are seperated
by 9 Khz by in te rnational treaty . If your signal
doesn' t conform you'll proba bly have your signal
ruined by a horrible whistle, and certainly have the
DTI and police down on you faster. If yo u have
problems getting a MW transmitter you may be able
to buy a kit (See Contacts) or adapt an amateur
radio transmitter.

ADAPTING A MW IRANSM.
I'm not exactly an expert on this and the
:ollowmg mto comes from the. OS. Apparently you
can easily buy second hand radio ham transmi tters
and adapt them. The best to go for is the Viking
Valian t (200watt) or the Viking Ranger (75watt),
bot h made by Johnson & Co. These ham radios are
well built, have excellent audio, and moreover have
built in VFO's ( variable frequency oscillators) which
. make them simple to modify to work on the top end
of the AM band. All you need to do to the RF (rad io
frequency ) circuits is to add capacitance to the 160
meter tuned circu its . And all you must do to the
audio circuits is to bypass tbe first pre -amp (assuming
you're using a line level instead of a mike level ,
One other thing, you must bypass the speech frequency
filter , which is located between the 2nd pre-amp
and the driver.
When buying such a 2nd hand ham transmitter
a) get one with 160 meter capability. b) Don't pay
mor e than £100 for one. c) make sure it has plate
modulation (look inside and check there are two
transformers well seperated from each other), and
e) don't get a 'kit built' one with dodgy wiring and
if possible check the valves before buying, they're
costly .
SETTING UP YOUR AERIAL (Medium Wave).
Security precautions and preparation are the
same as for FM. But there the similarity ends. For a
start your total aerial length is ¼ your wavelength ,
so if you r wavelength was 200 meters, for instance,
your aerial would be 50 meters long! You use ordinary
thin single strand wire. Buy a roll, keep it on t.he
ro ll and measure it out, metre by metre . Ideally the
aerial would poin t straight up, but thats just not
feasib le, unless you hang it out from the side of a
tower block or a steeple, or suspend it from a balloo!),
(only the balloon blows away). The mormal method
is the 'dogleg' which works just fine (See Diagram ).
The ideal site is a field, or deserted common land ,
far away from houses , with two tall trees ( only 2
if possible ,poplars are best) about 30 to 40 metres
apart . No1v strin g the 'dogleg' between the trees
and down to your TX with out touching branches or
leaves. Sounds impossible? If you have a trained
monkey thats just fine. Otherw ise try our method.
Pract ice and patien ce is nec essary .
Bring along with you a catapult, a long reel of
70 lb strength fishing line , and plenty of lead fishing
weights (not too heavy for the catap ult). Also some
small plastic rings (cut ou t lids of plastic containers
work fine).
SAMPLE CH£CKU ST. Things to :.iring along when
brnadc~ :,ling on Medium Wave ou tdoors .
Transmitter. TX batt ery leads. Cassette Deck . and
batte ry leads. Din lead born Cassette to TX. 12
volt and 6 volt batteries (charged). Earth leads
and stakes. Aerial wire. 70 lb fishing line and weights.
Catapult. Plastic rings. Disguise gear ( eg kite ,fishing
rods ). Screwdriver & pliers. Soldering iron & solder
with 12v trausformer (if possible ). Programme casss
o, torches or whistles.
and drink . Radio ;eceiven;. Waterproofs (warm ).
Possibly a ten! ..
Tie one end .,f the fishing line to a lead weight,
leaving the line coiled neatly and loosely on a piece
of bare ground. Then fire th e lead Wfiglit from the
catapult right over the centre of a tree! Go and search
for it (don't try this at night). Tie on your plastic
ring in place of tJ,e weight and pass about 30 metre
of your aerial wire th rou gh the ring. Now get your
mate to pull in the othe r end of the fishing line, if
it doesn't get tangled pull it till the ring is about 5
metres from the tree top. T ie the fishing line securely
(to the tree), cut it , and head for the second tree.
Repeat the perfor mance, firin g right over the tree
from the far side. Pull the aerial end through, and this
time tie it to the ring. Pul l up as befo re to about 5m
from the top and tie the line. Now back to the roll
of aerial wire (extende d with fishing line as necc.)
and start pulling it in till its suspend ed without
touching the trees! Its hard to get it just 1ight so the
aerial reaches your X and is tight, adjust fishing line
lengths and/or pos ition of TX. Better choose two
trees too far apart than too close. When you finally
get it all set its h,mlly worth taking it down again
after the broadcast, thou gh you should loosen it off
or it'll snap in the wina.D isguise it if possible. A further
prob lem can be with kids and passers by,
disguise your actions, bringing along fishing rods or
a kite is a good ploy. One of the best broadcast sites
is a clearing in a large wood. On Med ium Wave
rem ember, you can go right outs ide the city and still
cover it and lo ts mo re besides .

SETTING UP THE GEAR ( Medium Wave ).
See the Diagram. The transm it ter should be on
wet ground. If its dry, wet it . Mud is good stuff. The
aerial wire should be taut all the way . Bushes are an
advantage, for concealment, but don't let any touch
the aerial. You power suppl y is a 12 volt car battery .
Bring two, well charg ed up, if you're broadcasting for
more than a few hours, Medium wave uses lots of
power. If your TX is on mains (240 vAC) you 'll have
to get it adap ted using a 'rotary inverter', its not
difficult. A lorry battery is the real thing, but what a
drag to carry! If there's a chance to go on mains, by
running a line from somewhere, you should go for it.

ring of metal stakes (eg tent stakes) and file off any
rust or dirt for good connections . Attach the stakes
securely to the chassis of your TX, with thick metal
straps or wires held by butterfly nuts or strong clean
battery clips.
So far so good . The cassette player, on the cont rary,
sho uld be off the ground, on a box or whatever.
As usual keep the din lead, battery leads , and aerial
wire as far apart from each othe r as possible. The
cassette player is normally powered by a 6 volt motor
bike battery, with suitabl e leads. Torch batteries are
dear and have a pathetic lifespan.
SWITCHING ON
Connect up your batteri es, load up your cassette
player with a 'I.rial tap e' and you're ready to go. (See
Diagram B ):
1) Tum tuning adjuster to the right till the meter
gives the lowest rending.
2) Tum 'load' adjuster till meter rises about 50 milli•
amps.
3) Tune again till it drop s about 25 Ma.
4) Load up again as above .
5) Carry 011 procedure till you get a load of about
150Ma on a 20 watt transmitter, or 1001\ta oo a 10
watt rig. Yow last tuning adjusbnent should produ ce
virtual ly no dip on the mete .r needle.
6) Adjust modulation in relati on to othe r channel s
to get your best sound . Ulle a radio rece iver held at
least 50 yards away for testing.
7) If there is ccac!tling, knocking or bad sound , repeat
from the beginning. Check that your stakes are in
we ll to damp ground, that all lines are well separa ted,
that aerial isn 't to uching tre es, hold receiver furt her
away, etc .
PACKING UP
When you're finished switch off immediately.
Then disconnec t everything and pack into holdalls
or large plast ic bag. Be especially careful carrying
the TX with its delicate valves. You should have
several sites, and switch as often as you crui. Don't
re-use a site afte r an attem pted bust. If you have a
good dry safe stash and are coming back best leave
your transmitter,cassette deck and leads the re, and
just take the batte ries back for rechar ging. Such a
stash should be in cover, be quite sure a hidden
watche r or bod with binoculars couldn't spot you
stashing the gear. Its likely that the DTI will send in
men to sneak up and watch yo u, prior to planning
a bust, so be careful, even when not on air, don't
relax till safely home.
and fingerprin t yo u. You can't refu .se under the
new Police Bill.
When nicked your best bet is to remain calm.
Demand to ring your solicito r. Don't panic, it 's
not the end or the world . Smile at the bastar ds.
Have a good !tip in the cell • you've done your best.
FrGHTING YOUR CASE. (See Legal Sectio n ).
I t's usually months before your summon s arrives,
if they decide they have a case. Get legal aid if at all
possib le, and a good solicitor who knows the,by now,
pretty complex legal situation. Plead NOT GUILTY ,
but beware if :vou have money, they may award costs

Legal Briefin (condensed and added to from:
FREE THE AIRW A YES. June 1984
The following is a summary of the legal aspects of unlicensed
broadcasting on land in the UK. The Acts of Parliament
are:
Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949
Wireless Telegraphy Act 1967
Telecommunications Act 1984
which we'll refer to as 'the 49 Act', 'the 67 Act' and 't he 84
Act'. We also include info about your rights under crimi~al
law generally, but NOT details of changes under the Police
and Criminal Evidence Bill. (Not then enacted. Ed).
THE OFFENCES
The main offence is under section 1.1 of the 49 Act as follows
"No person shall establish or use any station for wireless
telegraphy or install or use any apparatus for wireless telegraphy
except under the authority granted by the Secretary of
State, and any person who establishes or uses any station for
wireless telegraphy or installs or uses any apparatus for wireless
telegraphy except under and in accordance with such a
licence shall be guilty of an offence under this Act".
The terms 'sta tion for wireless telegraphy' and 'appara tus for
wireless telegraphy' are interpreted (s19.1) as referring to stations
and apparatus for emmitting or receiving over
paths which are not provided by any material substance constructed
or arranged for that purpose, of electromagnetic energy
of a frequency not exceeding 3 million mHz, for purposes
of conveying messages, sound or visual images, or for the actuation
or control of machinery or apparatus , or for purposes of
radar.
So 'appara tus for wireless telegraphy' includes relay transmitt ers
(links) and remote control devices as.well as broadcast transmitters.
(And also TV transmitters but possibly not infra red
'links' Ed.) The term 'station' is ambiguous and isn't interpreted
more under the 49 Act. Strictly speaking a station refers to
a 'place set apart and equipped for some particular pmpose'
and in this case should only refer to the transmitt ing site, and
only include the studio if' progs. are live, or possibly if broadcasting
takes place from the same premises as the studio.
For an offence to be made out under this section it has to be
shown that you have been involved in setting up or using a
transmitt' .ng site, or installing or operating transmitting gear.
Any of the site crew could be charged on the angle of being
'involved in establishing or using a transmit ting site'. But unless
programmes are live it shouldn't include people who make
programmes, supply tapes or interviews, advertise or provide a
mailing address. The DTI did once threa ten to do advertisers
for aiding and abett ing but this hasn't happened. (also not till
1986 . Ed)
Under the 49 Act its unlikely that you'd be prosecuted unless
the transmitti ng gear has been tracked down or traced ............ .
... (but under the 84 Act you can be. Ed) .. and you had to be
more or Jess caught in the act.
Section 7 of the 67 Act (as substitude by s77 of the 84 Actj
provides for the Secretary of State, for the purpose of prevent ing
or reducing the risk of interference with wireless telegraphy,
to make orders applying restrictions to wireless telegrphy
apparatus of any class or description. Any of the folowing
actions are subject to restriction under this section:
a) manufacture (whether or not for sale)
b) selling or offering for sale, letting or offering to let on hire
or indicating one's willingness to let on hire
c) having in one's custody or control
d) importation
(its made clear that manufacture includes construction by any

this appe~re to apply to only CB rigs (with an inbuilt or connected

40.
THE P
49 Act (S ct'onl.1) The main offence of unlicensed broadcasting.
Its a 1su mary convicticn (ie magistrates court) and the
maximum p nalty is 3 months in prison or a fine of up to
£2 ,000 ot b th. In practice present penalties (1986) range
from £20p t £1000 for a first offence. It depends where you
are (in C~nt l London fines tend to be much higher than elsewhere)
an:d n the mood of the magistrate (check they haven't
got share~ in :,our local IBA franchise!) Fines are likely to be
greater fot p rsons seen as ringleaders, and for 2nd or 3rd offences,
with he chance of a suspended sentence after more
convictio*. But we have no reports of anyone going to prison
yst, and spm people have a dozen convictions. Ed 1986)
I
Also undt'r t e 49 Act (sl. 1) its an offence to listen to pirate
radio.So o r entire audience is breaking the law! We have a
record of o e member of an Our Radio team being done for
this (they c .uldn't get him on anything else). He got a £30
fine.</p>

<p> Under Section 7 of the '67 Act (manufacture, sale, poLssion,
not importing) the penalty is a max. fine of £2000, wHen such
'Restriction Orders' are in force (see above).
' Under Section 5a of the 49 Act (as amended bys heclule s75
of the 84 Act) you can get a max £2,000 or 6 mon hs prison or
both for 'sending false or misleading messages b · means of
wireless telegraphy, which are likely to affect any s fe1;y of life
service or endanger the safety of any person or o anr vessel,
aircraft or vehicle. j
Under Section 13 of the 49 Act (as amended bys e1u1e 3 of
the 84 Act) its an offence if you're 'Using any a pa~atus for
the purpose of interfering with wireless telegraph '. ~Deliberate
interference or 'jamming'. The penalties are ti. e Jsame as
for section 5a above. 1
I
POWERS OF ENFORCEMENT
I
To bring proceedings under the Wireless Tele rabhy Act
requires the consent of the Sec. of State. In p ac~ice this
means that the DTI decides whether to press charge . ~o it was
usually (and usually still is) a 'summons offence'. fypu were
taken to the copshop unwillingly it was either o a Jpretext
charge (like suspicion of stealing electricity) or unla f4lly. But
the 84 Act (s76) (which applies to offen ces unde sl.1, s5a,
and s13 of the• 49 Act) gave a constable power to rj1st without
a warrant a person who has committed, or wh m he constable
with reasonable cause suspects to have co mi ted, an
offence to which this section applies, if the name nd! address
are unknown to and cannot be ascertained by th c9nstable,
or the constable has reasonable grounds for doubt' g whether
the .person has given their real name and address, r }vhether
the person will be at that address for a sufficiently ong period
for it to be possible to serve them with a summons. I
This hampers wily pirates from slipping off it~ a false
name and address (but if such an address is easily eqfiable it
should still be possible. Ed) and in practice giv s ~he filth
power to arrest on suspicion.
UNDER ARREST I
I
Once you' re nicked its like any other arrest. o,.I should
try and take notes, get the number of the cop who ic~ed you,
ask to see a solicitor immediately under the new 'D ty !Solicitor'
scheme, refuse to answer any questions , refuse to b photographed
or fingerprin ted (though they don't need a agistrate's
warrant now to force this), only sign for your own ossessions
and not for the TX gear they may add on the list, et .
In practice since its the DTI and not the cops wlo bring
prosecutions under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts y on't be
charged then and there. What they will do is in rvi w you
separate ly and then let the DTI (radio Investigati n . ervice)
interview you. You don't have to say anything to t e9 either,
especially don't talk to that old charmer Eric Got s who will
try and trick info and admissions out of you .
They're supposed to let you go as soon as they 1ve ,decided
not to charge you (you get that by a summons). Bi;it they can
hold you up to 3 days. Keep banging on the door 'and as;.ing
for your phone call. The only delay should be lwhiie t~ey
check out your address, th_ough of course they'll e <1teckmg
if you're wanted for anything else. There should b nr question
of bail if you haven' t been charged. ,
I
SEARCHES, CONFISC)T IONS, FORFEIT RES ....
Section 19 of the 49 Act provides for the Issue bf search
warrants . They last for a month and authorise any ne named
by the Sec. of State to search a premises or vehicle n exam-
41.
ine or test any apparatus they find. This didn't allow them
to seize anything till the case came to court, but this loopho le
was never realised till 83, when there followed an upsurge of
pirates till the 84 Act brought in new powers.
The search powers were extended by the 84 Act and
brought in wholesale confiscation powers. (By s79 of the 84
Act which applies to offences under sl.1,s5a and s13 of the
49 Act and s7 of the 67 Act) .. Subsection 79.2 provides for
the inclusion in such search warrants of the authority to seize
and detain, for the purpose of relevant proceedings, any apparatus
OR OTHER THING found in the course of the search,
which appears to have been used in connection with or to be
evidence of the commission of any of these offences.
This new power allowed the current practice of tracing
and raiding stud ios and confiscating everything, and was reaffirmed
by the Horizon Radio case of 1985, when a studio
valued at £20,000 was confiscated (down to chairs and carpet)
and, though the case was denied and the TX gear was never
found, the DJ's were found guilty and fined in addition to
the confiscation.
When faced with a Search warrant don't open the door,
examine it through a window or letter box. Check the date,
(if its valid)who it allows to search, if it allows for body search,
if it allows for seizure of evidence, any names etc. Then ask
them for I.D. to check if they are those authorised . After
that its an offence to obstruct them. If you have an escape
rou te, use it!
Under s80 of the 84 Act they can order forfeiture of any
gear restricted under s7 of the 67 Act whether anyone is charged
or not. If you're convicted they must order forfeiture.
Proceedings must be brought within six months. After
that you can forget it.
Apparatus of the stat ion does NOT include the stud io
unless programmes are done live.
CLAIMING BACK YOUR GEAR
If you haven't been charged after six months, or if you've
won your case (sometimes happens!) you can in theory claim
back anything seized. You write to the Radio Regulatory Dept
of the DTI or your local Radio Interference Division, or better
g!.t a good solicitor to write, giving a clear description of the
gear and saying you're the owner and can prove it. Such proof
could be receipts for items like batteries, cassette players or an
identifying mark on the gear. Don't admit to anything else but
ownership, any other evidence that you've committed an offence
and you could still be prosecuted. (Ask your solicitor
first if there is an 'Order in force under Section 7 of the 67
Act prohibiting 'custody or control' of TX gear).
GOING TO COURT
Usually its by Summons, (unless under s5a or sl 3 it'll
be in the magistrates court) if you get one get yourself a
solicitor who knows someth ing about it and Legal Aid if at
all possible. Even if you're caught red handed you can deny
everything and sometimes get away with it. If you' re bending
the truth a little don't tell your solicitor as they won't go
along with it. If you think you have any chance at all plead
Not Guilty, often solicitors will tell you to plead guilty just
to save themselves the bother . But remember that the Magistrates
Court is basically controlled by the police and most
magistrates are right wing to ries (the old ones are often more
liberal than the young Thatche r lovers). The police and the
DTI witnesses will lie through the ir teeth if necessary to nail
you. For instance the head of the DTI 's RIS squad, Eric
Gotts once told a magistrate he recognised an Our Radio member
putting up an aerial on top of a 22 story tower block at
night,from ground level, the evidence was accepted.
Be polite and courteous and smile at the bastards if you
want to get off, and get your stat ion to organise a bust fund
and benefit to pay your fine. You can appeal against the
decision, and you go to the Crown Court with a barrister,
check with your solicitor if its worth it, you may have to
pay high costs if you lose.

FOREWARD
The following is by no means an introd uction to electronics,
there are many such books that cover the subject , but intends
to explore some of the ideas and concept involved in
radio broadcasting that are relevant to the pirate radio operator
on VHF FM. In particular we will go a step by step tour of
a ty pical VHF FM transmitter system starting with the output
from the tape recorder or mixer, and finishing with a brief
discussion of aerials. At each stage we will discuss the pros and
cons of varios alternatives and additional background info,
eg. the use of test equipment will be introduced
Radio Frequency signals have AMPLITUDE and FREQENCY.
The frequency is how fast the signal is oscillating from
one extreme to the other and back again. Frequency is measured
in cycles per second (cp/s), which these days are known
as HERTZ (Hz), l000Hz - lkHz, 1,000,000Hz - 1 MHz The
amplitude is to what extent the signal is oscillating. LEVEL or
STRENGTH can be thought of as meaning the same as amplitude.
Amplitude can be measured in Volts (v). There is more
than one way of measuring amplitude.
INTRODUCT ION
What we are trying to is get information from one place to
lots of others. I'm using information here in a wider sense,
meaning speech, music etc., rather than phone numbers of
local hairdressers or whatever. Now ['m going to assume we're
going to use radio broadcasting to achieve this, which immediately
rules out things like standing on top of tall buildings and
shouting really loud. We'll also assume we've got this info in
the form of an audio frequency signal, ie. what comes out of a
tape recorder or an audio mixer. You can't transmit audio
frequency signals very easily so what we can do is impart the
info in the audio frequency signal onto a higher frequency
carrier signal. 'l\vo ways of doing this are AMPLITUDE MODULATION
and FREQUENCY MODULATION (AM and FM).
In AM the ampltude of the carrier is determined at every
instant by the ampltude of the audio signal, the carrier freqency
remains constant. In FM the frequency of the carrier is
determined at every instant by the amplitude of the audio
signal, and the carder amplitude remains consta nt.

Th~re re two sorts of FM, known as Narrow Band FM
(NBFM) a d Wideband FM. They differ by the maximum
allowable f equency shift of the carrier when the transmitter is
fully m~d lated. This frequency shift is known as the DEVIATION.\
L gal CB radios use NBFM with a maximum deviation
of & k . Wideband FM is used by the BBC and IBA for
radio bfoa casting and for studio to transmitter links. The
standard m ximum deviation for FM radio broadcasting in this
country lis 5kHz. There is no simple way to set the deviation
6f a trans itter without a Deviation Meter which is an expensive
piece o test gear. Probably the best way to do this is to
vary th~ le el of the audio sig~al going into the transmitter
(TX) and l sten on a receiver, until your signal sounds about
the sam~ 1 udness as the other (legal) broadcast stations. lf
you use !to high a deviation you'll use a bigger than necessary
chu!k f the radio spectrum and be more likely to cause
interfere~c to others , which will make you even more unpopular
with t DTI.
The police use NBFM as well, which is why if you Ustt:n
to them on an ordinary FM receiver, which is wideband, you
can hear m re than one channel at a time.

the UK FM broadcast band is 88 to 97 .6 _M a d 102.1

locations of all FM broadcast stations. What it do sn t say ,of
course, is the frequency of exist ing pirates. TX Maga ine gives
a good rundo wn of these (see CONTACTS). Armi1d vith this
info you should make a list of all frequencies in se n, say, a
30 mile radius . If you write to the BBC or IBA's n ineering
Info Offices they' ll send you service maps of whe t'eir TX's
are meant to be able to be heard. Then its just a qutstlon of
finding a big enough gap between stations, with th~ proviso
that your station shouldn't be nearer than 2 0 Hz (0.2
MHz) to the frequency of any existing station. Thi is no prob lem
as the band is half empty. Also don't choose f equency
which is 10 .7 MHz away from any other station f r compl ex
reasons (which involve the use of 10.7 MHz as i t ediate
frequency in FM. receivers) reception will be har f r people
listening to you and /or the other station.
Now lets take a littl e stroll through the whole ys m.
TAPE OR LIVE 1
What are we going to feed into our TX? The b ious two
possi bili ties are '
a) A tape or cassette player .
b) Live, eith er directly from the mixer or via s · m kind of
link from studio to TX site (highly recommen ded) .
TAPE. This is the safest approach in that you ea p t a tape
on and then retire to a safe distance. Links ar n w being
traced and stud ios buste-d, and some of the bigge p rates ( eg
LWR) are going back to taped broadcasts. If th TI trace
your transmission and turn up all they can do it cbnfiscate
your tape plater, TX and aerial, ie no arrests (unles$ they catch
you changi_ng the tape!). Its also the most inflexibl' alterna tive
as tapes will have to be prepared in advance. Time checks, if
you're into that, will be difficu lt and live phone l'ns are right
out. I
. Give a little thought to your choice of tape reco~er, as it
will probably be the weakest link in terms of soun qiality. In
an old clapped out one the heads will be worn flat. M ybe you
can use a 'Walkman' type of player, which are s al, can be
battery powered and have ok quality and are chea; . ' n amat eur
radio rally I was at recently were selling off e slightly
damaged ones for £2 each. To reduce 'n oise' o 't pe hiss'

T
on such recorders, if you're doing programmes with quiet
passages, you can use a circuit known as a Dynamic Noise
Limiter (DNL), which is placed on the output and cuts off
the 'noise' just in quiet pauses. DNLs are sometimes used
in the soundtracks of old films. You can find a DNL circuit
in part of the 'Audio Embellisher' project in the Jan 84 issue
of 'Elector' magazine.
If you want to go upmarket you could use a proper
¼" reel to reel tape recorder, though few pirates do. The latest
and greatest is to use 'Stack machines' which will change the
tapes for you. Whatever you use get one that can be battery
powered as you may not always have access to mains power.
MONO OR STEREO
The advantages of mono are that the TX is kept as simple
and cheap as possible, and you don't need as much power as
on stereo to get the same result. The disadvantages are you
don't sound as professional, quite small pirates are now using
Stereo Encoders, and maybe people might dial past when the
red stereo light on their receivers doesn't flash. With stereo
the _ listen~r can get quality the same as legal sta tions. Weigh
agamst this the extra: cost, extra circuitry and more output
power needed for the same signal.
What you need is a Stereo Encoder, which combines the
l~ft and . rig~t stereo signals into a single composite stereo
signal which 1s then fed into your TX.

For those inte resterl a brief technical description follows.
The left (L ) and Right (R) signals are fed into a summing and
differential amp to get a L+R and L- R signal respectively. The
L- R signal is mixed in a balanced modulator with a 38kHz
sub carrier to produce an amplitude modulated double sideband
suppressed carrier signal. The 38kHz signal is derived from the
same source as the 19kHz pilot tone. The composite output is
formed by mixing the L+ R signal, the side bands containing the
info of the L- R signal, and a bit of 19kHz pilot tone. The
pilot tone switches on the Stereo Decoder in peoples' receivers.

Frequency (kc)
Composite modulating signal.
Back in the receiver, once the Stereo Decoder has extracted
the L+ R and L- R signal the original left and right signals
are easily got by (L+R) + (L- R) • 2L
(L+R) - (L-R) • 2R
The reason L+R and L- R signals are encoded rather than L
and R is so that a mono receiver can just demodul ate the L+ R
bit and ignore the rest of the signal. If L and R were encoded a
mono reciver would only be able to hear the left channel. The
19kHz pilot tone is usually got from a crystal oscillator, to be
quite accurate and stable. A crystal resonating on 4.8640 MHz
is convenient as 4864 divided by 2 eight times is 19 kHz. This
can easily be done by digital logic chips. But its highly unlikely
you'll be able to buy a 4.8640 crystal off the shelf, so you'll
have to have one made to order.
We had hoped to include a design fo a Stereo Encoder in
this book, but we haven't got it yet . See CONTACTS for
where you can buy the design or a ready made system.
It doesn't matte r if you dictn't understand all of the above
but one thing is important. The stan dard FM broadcast audio
bandwidth extends only to 15kHz and Stereo Encoders are
designed to assume this figure. If you put signals into them
with frequencies above that the L+R signal and the lower side
band of the L-R signal could spread into each other and you
will get a right bloody mess. With a tape recorder you can't
really get over 15kHz, but if you're live its quite possible.
In that case you need a LOW PASS FILTER on each input
to a stereo encoder. Maplin have a high quality design on page
243 of their current catalogue (summer 86). The pot could be
replaced with a 500k resistor to wire the circuit permanently
for max roll off. If you're using a link between studio and
TX and you want stereo wou'll have to know the bandwidth
of the link. If its 53kHz (~ 38+15) or more you can use-it
after the encoder. Otherwise you'll need two links and have to
encode at the TX end.
PRE- EMPHASIS
In a typical audio signal the high frequency sounds have
Jess energy than the low ones and so produce less deviation of
the carrier. This in turn makes them susceptible to 'n oise'
when received. To avoid this high frequencies are boosted
before being trans mitted by PRE-EMPHASIS. In the receiver
the frequencies are cut by the same amount by DE-EMPHASIS.
So the overall frequency response of TX to receiver stays flat,
but the level of background noise is reduced a lot.
Pre and De-emphasis net works are characterised by their
TIME CONST ANT. In the USA the standard is 75 ,uS, but in
44 .
UK its : 50 S so anything designed or bought from there needs
slight f o ·nca tion. In a mono TX the pre-emphasis network
can be bu t into the front end of the excite r. For a stereo TX
such a ne work must NOT be in the exciter or it'll play hell
with t e omposite stereo signal from the encoder. Instead
you n~ed 2 networks, one for each channel, on the inputs of
the stereo encoder, They'r e actually often built into the studio
encode~.

A o pressor compresses, it reduces the DYNAMIC
RANG o its input signal. This means as the input amplitude
varies ve a certain range, the output ampltude varies over
only a ac ·on of that range. The graph shows a 2:1 compression
cha ac ristic. In this case with every change in the input
amplitu e , he output changes only half as much. The dotted
line sho vs t 1: 1 non compressed characteristic.
But a Limiter passes its signal unaffected till the input
arnplitu e eaches its THRESHOLD. At this point the limiter
preven t e output increasing much by compressing its input
much m r strongly than in compressors eg 10:1.
So e merican music stations and some pirates compress
their pr~g mmes to make it seem 'louder' and more 'upfront'
than ot er tations, This occurs cos the compressor keeps the
average ev I of the signal high, even in quiet parts of the
prog. T e · p side of this is listeners can soon get 'listener
fatigue' onstant compre~ion can become boring and irritatin6
to ear, as if the music were rammed into it!
Compression has other uses, you might co
programme as you transfer it to tape to stop
fading into background tape hiss when played. Th pr cess of
recording and replaying does this to some exte t .tnyway.
Don't compress the output of a tape recorder as it'! m~ke tape
noise worse. Guitar effect units, labelled comp ssbrs, are
unlikely to be much use. Compressors intended fo~ use in
home studio recording are worth experiment ing wi . -i\s tereo
compressor with a 2:1 characteristic can be simply orlstructed
around a NE570 or NE571 IC, ~-
Limiters are used to stop a signal's amplitude gong over
a certain level. Eg when cutting a master disc in rec r manufacture,
large PA systems at gigs to stop loudspeak rs blowing
ev_ery time someone burps in a mike and, surprise urprise, in
broadcasting. In FM particularily, as the signal lev l ipcreases
so also does the bandwidth of the transmitted si~al ( risking
interfering with other stations. With tape input to y'puii TX the
output is imherently limited by the recording pro s1 no limiter
needed. With live input to the TX its differe t. ,Though
you might set the levels right to start , along co ei/ a loud
record or voice and you could be interfering wi · ~he next
station . Use a limiter. j

THE OSCILLATOR
At the heart of everything is the OSCILLL TOR that
generates the VHF signal. The Frequency of this · niodulat ed
by applying an audio signal to it. The most co ~6n way
of doing this is by using one or two V ARICAP di def. When
a varicap diode is operated with a reverse bias the ap,citance
of the diode varies with that bias. The diode(s) is/ re ~onnected
to a frequency determining part of the osc· la~or. The
audio signal is connected across the diode to achiev fr4quency
modulation. Also by varying the DC reverse bias t o~cillator
can be fine tuned. The higher the voltage, the low r the capacitance,
the higher the frequency. !
The VHF signal can either be generated dire tlYi , or the
oscillator can oscillate on a lower frequency eg a t ir4 or half
that desired and then followed by a TRIPLER or OJlJBT~ER
stage. There are three main types of oscillator: ·
a) Variable Frequency Oscillator (VFO).
b) Crystal Oscillator.
c) Phase locked Loop Oscillator (PLL).
VFO's
These are simple oscillators which can be bu It round a
single transistor. This can be:
Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT). {;
Field Effect Transistor (FET). ~
The problem with oscillators based on BJT.sr·s ~hat the
frequency is too dependent on the temperature o the transistor.
ie a few degrees temperature change will resu t .in a significant
change in transmitting frequency. For this re oμ oscillators
based on BJT's are UNSUITABLE for serio s hse as a ' ' TX. FET's don' t suffer from this problem so badl,y, 'so they
can be used, but you should still bear it in mind. l
The FET will heat itself up slightly, and other; bits of the
TX, like the power amps, will be fair old chucking heat out,
and are usually built into the same case as the osc'llator . The
frequency will drift most when the TX is 1st swi ch'd on as
all the components will be at the same temperatu e the air
ouside the TX's case, this is known as the AMBI N TEMP-
45.
ERATURE, After the TX is turned on the heat from the amps
will warm the air in the case directly or indirectly .As the FET
warms the frequency will drift a bit. When heat loss equals
heat gain you get THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM and it wont
drift more. Keep your TX out of drafts to avoid messing this
up. If you have a frequency counter plug in to a dummy load
and see how long it takes for the f~equency displayed to settle
down, maybe about 15 minutes. If you have time you can
arrive at the TX site early and run your TX for the warm up
time with no input into a dummy load. This avoids listeners
who tune in immediately having to retune as you r frequency
drifts.
CRYSTAL OSCILLATORS
This is also a simple oscillator but incorporates a crystal
into the frequency determining network. There are various
types of crystal (fundamental, 3rd overtone, 5th overtone etc)
and various ways of using them (series mode, parallel mode)
but their basic propert ies are the same. They're resonant on
one frequency which is determined by the crystal's characteristics
when made. This is their problem, whereas VFO's are
not very stable crystal oscillators are too bloody stable and
its a job to get enough deviation. You'll probably lose the
higher frequencies of your programme and stereo is right out.
Also chances are you'll have to get a crystal made to order for
your desired frequency so if you want to change it you'll
ne.ed a new one. There are places which make crystals to order.
PHASE LOCKED LOOP (PLL) OSCILLATORS
The way its done properly is with the Phase Locked Loop
oscillator. Tis combines the ease of tuning and wide deviation
of a VFO with the frequency stability of a crystal oscillator.
It works thus: A crystal oscillator is used to provide a reference
frequency . This is digitally divided by logic chips to a relatively
low frequency, say 25kHz. A VFO provides the output,
which is also digitally divided to give another relatively low
frequency. These two low frequencies are presented to a
PHASE COMPARA'l'OR which basically decides which freqency
is higher by comparing the phases of the two siganls. The
phase comparator generates an ERROR VOLTAGE which is
connected back to the input of the VFO through a LOW PASS
FILTER (LPF). This is the loop bit.
If the VFO is running too fast the phase comparator decreases
the error voltage so as to slow it down till the phases at
its input are the same. If its running too slow the error voltage
is increased to speed it till the phases are the same. All this
happens. instantaneously of course so the output frequency
remains constant.
In this way the temperature stability of the VFO isn't
important and it can be built round a BJT, as its output freqency
is phase locked to the crystal oscillator, and the frequency
of this is very good. Clever eh?
Two more things to explain. How do you change the output
frequency? By making the VFO's divider programmable.
Say its set to divide by the number N. The phase comparator
is a simple minded sort of soul, concerned only with equalising
the phases at its inputs, it doesn't know whats really coming
out of the VFO, which is N times the divided reference
signal. Because this signal is so low compared to the VFO frequency
N can be made to have hundreds of different values,
giving hundreds of different output frequencies from the VFO.
So changing the frequencies is just a matter of clicking some
little switches. (Beats me ... typissed).
Hang on a sec, the VFO is being frequency modulated by
the audio input, so its frequency at any given instant depends
on the voltage of the audio output. We don't want THIS

variation of the VFO's frequency to be ironecl out by the PLL
system so we 'iron ·out' the error voltage from the phase comparator,
so it just contains the underlying trend rather than
whats happening at any split second . This is the purpose of the
low pass filter.
This system can be simplified by leaving out the dividers.
If this is done you end up with an output frequency 'determined
solely by the crystal. You've still got the wide deviat•
ion capability of course, which distinguishes this system from
one based on a simple crystal oscillator. This sort of fixed fre•
quency oscillator is used for things like wireless mikes and
could be used for stud io to TX links. Programmable PLL
oscillators are used in all manner of professional communications
equipment, including broadcast TX's .
We don't include a PLL oscillator design in this•book. Its
a bit complex to start with and tbe IC's are expensive .. See
CONTACTS for where to get the design. or ready made.
BUFFERS
Any oscillator, regardless of its type, is followed by a
buffer. This is usually one or two transistors operating in what
is known as class A mode . Its function is to protect the oscillator
from what is going on further along the circuit, especially
from changes in its 'load' as the following stage is tuned.
The combination of oscillator and buffer together is called
the EXCITER and is a small but fully fledged TX. Small in
respect to its output power. Typical values are in the region of
100. 500 mW (lO00mW = lW).
AMPLIFIERS
To increase the power output of our fledgling TX we need
to add an amplifier. Obviously we are talking about Radio Freqency
(RF) amps, not audio amps. RF amps have certain important
characteristics: a) Bandwidth b) Gain and maximum
power output c) Input and output impedence.
BANDWIDTH This is the range of frequencies the amp will
amplify properly. The Bandwidth is ultimate ly limltect by
the characteristics of the active devices in the amp (ie the transistors
or valves) but more specifically by its type, LINEAR or
a TUNED amplifier.
A linear amp will amplify quite a large range of frequenci es
and they have a good bandwidth, commonly 1.8 • 30MHz
which covers all of the amateur shortwave broacast bands ..
no good for a VHF pirate, but could be useful for a MW
pirate. They operate in class A or B mode and have the advant·
age that they don' t need adjusting when the frequency is
changed. Their disadvantage are they're more complex and
46.
dearer~th n tuned amps and are much harder to desi.gn, requiring
e te ive knowledge of the transistors round which the
amp is co truc.ted. Linear amps for VHF are uncommon .
T ne amps only amplify a narrow band of frequencies,
they h~ve a small bandwidth, centred on one frequency which
is determ·,ned by the TUNED CIRCUITS in the input and output
netw r-ks of the amp. Tuned circuit have a RESONANT
fre.quijcy. This can be adjustedby variable capacitors known
as tri rs, to the desired frequency . The amp will produce
max o tp t when the tuned circuits resonant frequency is the
same .s he input frequency from the exciter. Tuned amps
often <l,pe ate In the class C mode, which is more efficient than
A or ~- is means more of the power being drawn from the
battery o whatever turns into watts up the aerial rather than
heat itj t e amp. They are relatively simple circuits, and are
easier io esign. The bandwidth is a trade -off with gain, the
wider he bandwidth the less the gain. The disadvantages of
a tune a p is, of course, you have to tune it to the frequency
·you re sing and if you change the frequency you'll
youLlllha f! to retune to maintain the gain of the amp.
GAIN D MAXIMUM OUTPUT POWER
I
T~e OWER GAIN (as opposed to a voltage or current
gain v,thi h is different) of an apip is defined as a ratio:
power ~ai = output power
, input power
and is ~ easure of the amps ability to make its input 'bigger'.
Power !gai s are often expressed in DECIBELS ( dB) which are
define~: power gain (dB) - 10 log.., output power
; input power
Amps !als have a max output power. When this is reached
increa~in the input power wont result in more output power
and m~y amage the amp.
In' th case of single stage (ie one transistor) class C tuned
amps ~he gain and max outpu t power of the amp is basically
the g➔n nd max. output power of the transistor. Knowing
these ~e can calculate the power necessary to produce the
max qut ut power. EG lets consider the popular MRF237
transis~or According to the makers data sheet this has a max
outpu' p wer of 4w and a gain of 12dB. First we've to convert
the ga¥1 i dB to ordinary gain :

Input power = Output power - 4 .. 0.25w

- 250mW
So for 4w output power we need 250mW input o er. Most
exciters can manage this, hence the popularity of he MRF237
in the 1st amp after the exciter. The joker in the plk is that
all these figures are for a frequency of 175mHz, t at n which
the transistor was designed. You can't predict, a happens
at l00mHz and have to experiment.
The MRF238 has 30w output power and a ai of 9dB,
so it needs 3.8w input power. This can be h d from the
MRF237. Thats how the makers (Motorola Cor e. planned
it.
INPUT AND OUTPUT IMPEDENCE i
Impedence is the alternat ing current (AC) ve ioj of resistance.
The standard impedence outputs of excite '1d outputs
and inputs of amps is 50n . The impedence f f e input
and the outpu t networks of an amp is altered t e tuned
circuits which you recall also tune the circuit in tu ed amp.
The INPUT IMPEDENCE is important as it effec tt LOAD
the amp has on the stage before it. Max powerJs t ansferred
between stages when the impedence of the outp t d input
are equal. If the impedences aren't equal a Ml Mi,ATCH is
said to occur and in this case some energy is re eoted back
from the input of a stage into the output of t e ~receding
one, where its wasted as heat . I
THE VSWR METER
Some of you may know that we can use a R meter
(also known as Voltage standing wave ratio meter S R meter
or a Reflectometer) to detect mismatch between T and the
aerial, but the VSWR meter is just as much at oipe doing
this between amp stages. VSWR is the ratio of tthe
1
fonvard
(or incident) and reflected power. Except for de r qnes they
work the same. The switch is set. to Forward r 1the SET
button is pressed. The knob is then adjusted 1o !bake the
meter read full scale. The switch is then set t~ Rbverse or
the button is pre-released. It now indicates the V~WR. A
VSWR of 1:1 is perfect (n_ o reflected power) and soiunlikely.
One of 00:1 shows all the power is reflected b ck into the
amp, you'll get this with a VSWR connected Ito the amp
output with nothing on the VSWR output (unl~ss its got a
built in dummy load). You'll also get it if th re'f a short
circuit in the VSWR meter. In either case switch ff MMEDIATELY
or you'll blow your power transistor.
47.
Ov
The point of all this is to get the max power output
from the amp into the aerial, instead of a hot TX and a bad
signal.
To tune such an amp you need a LOAD connected to the
output (or it'll blow up). We could use an aerial but this introduces
an extra unknown quantity .. the characteristics of the
aerial. As well as the fact that we'd be broadcasting. What we
need is a DUMMY LOAD.
THE DUMMY LOAD
This is basically a resistor, made so it presents a load to
the amp's output independent of frequency (unlike the aerial).
The 3 things about a dummy load we're interested in are:
a) It should be suitable for the frequency we're interested in,
about l00mHz .
b) It should be rated to take the power we're trying to make.
c) It should have a resistance of 50.n. .To match the output
network of the amp.
When buying ask for one for the 2 meter band , amateur radio,
centred on 145mHz. Most test gear for this band ( dummy
loads, VSWR meters, power meters, wavemeters, RF volt
meters, frequency counte rs etc) will work on the frequencies
we're interested in.
The amp should first be tuned with reduced input power and
supply voltage. Adjust the input network trimmers Cl & C2 for
the best input match (lowest reading on a VSWR meter connected
to the input side) and adjust the output trimmers for
max output power. Be sure the extra power is in the frequen cy
you want and not in the HARMONICS. Check with a wave
meter (more of this coming up). Another VSWR meter can be
used for a relative indication of the output power, or the RF
PROBE, described on page will give an absolute indication.
The pairs of trimmers are very interdependent, adjust one and
you'll have to adjust the other, and so on.
This done, if all OK, increase the input power by increasing
the voltage supply to the previous stage, and the voltage
supply slightly and repeat the tuning. Do all this a few times
till you reach the required levels. Listen in on a nearby (but
not too near) receiver. The signal should be in just one place
on the dial with no funny noises or modulations going on.
Check with a wave-meter. Altering the trimmers and varying
the input power and supply voltage should result in smooth
variations of the supply current and output power with no
steps or jumps. The exception is, as the input power is reduced
at some point the amp will switch off, a characteristics of
Class C amps .
To vary the supply voltage you need a Variable Stabilised
Power Supply Unit. If you can't get hold of one you could
build one. They're not expensive and are well handy, and give
you some experience, if needed, of electronic construction .
HARMONICS
Harmonics are multiples of the transmitting frequen cy.
For a frequency of lO0mHz, the 1st harmonic, known as the
FUNDAMENTAL is l00mHz, The second is 200mHz, the 3rd
id 300mHz etc. They're produced as side effects in various
parts of the circuit and will interfere with other users of these
frequencies if let escape from the TX. Known as RADIO FREQ·
UENCY INTERFERENCE (RFI). Tuned class C amps dont
amplify harmonics, as they're out of the range of the amps
abilities. But the use of Class C means that harmonics are
generated by the amp along with the desired frequency. The
strongest ones (apart from the fundamental) from such amps
are usually the 3rd, then the 5th etc . The amplitude of harmonics
is minimised if the output netwo rks are tuned properly,
but they're still there. Oscillat_ors and Buffers can also make
harmonics if not set up right.
WAVEMETERS
To detect harmonics we need an ABSORBTION WA VEMETER
usually called just a wavemeter. Or we can use a
GRID DIP OSCILLATOR (GDO) or a gate dip oscillator, both
of which are known as DIP Jl;JETERS. Most dipmeters have a
switch which turns them into wavemeters, A wavemeter has
a tuning knob, calibrated in frequency, a meter showing signal
strength, and some kind of short aerial. You hold the aerial
near a coil in the bit of the circuit your're interested in, and
tune the wavemeter. It shows how much signal is present on the
frequencies shown on the scale. So you can see what frequ encies
are being generated in that part of the cicuit. Idea:; :r
you 'll just find the fundamental, unless the circuit is a freque ncy
tripler or something.
If you buy a wavemeter be sure it covers the right range,
from below l0OmHz to get the fundamental to above 300mHz
to get the 3rd harmoinic.
Even with all tuned right you're still going to have some
harmonics generated by the last stage. A sensible pirate wont
Jet these reach the aerial, e.g. if you'r e using a frequency of
102.35mHz the third harmonic is 307 .05Mhz which happens
t0 be that used by USAF Upper Heyford's Control Tower.
You might think this funny but you won't stay on the air for
long. To stop harmonics reaching the aerial we need a BAND•
PASS FILTER.
Each amp bumps up the power some more, cos the trans istor
in each one can only supply so much gain. So if you'r e
the proud owner of a 5 watter and you're offered a 1000w
amp its useless as you'd need probably 100w input to driie
it so you'd need amps in between.
To tune a series of amps on your TX you must break in,
physically if needed , to tune each one at a time. Do this by
unsoldering components and soldering in short bits of co-ax
with plugs to connect to dummy load and VSWR meter.
BANDPASS FILTER
This filter only allows through a narrow band of frequencies,
ie it has a narrow bandwidth, a good one would be less
than lMHz .It needs standard 50 input and output impedence
and be able to take the power you're using and be tuned
to the frequency you want let through. Other frequencies are
reduced drastically , by an amount known as INSERTION
LOSS
reduced drastically. It reduces also the desired frequency
slightly, by an amount known as INSERTION LOSS. To keep
this loss low bandpass filters for high output powers are usually
pretty chunky numbers.
Pirate gear doesn' t have this filter built into the final
stages so if you need one you have to add it on.It needs a well
48.
screened 1ca e to stop harmonics leaking out. In fact your whole
TX should e well screened for the same reason . Say for eg
you use4 a shoebox and had you:r oscillator on a third of a
frequenct o 92.25mHz .. you could be interfering with pagers
of a local hospital as they use 31.75mHz. Proper screening
and ajba dpass filter will eliminate such possibilities.

CONN~C ORS
As yjou may have guessed you can't use any connectors on
VHF as ~he have to match the amp and feeder. Use BNC or
the UHFl se ies (pL259 plug and SO239 socket). UHF is best
for higher owers as you can get a wider cable into the plug.
N type isf·a.ls good but dearer
FEEDE S
So y u' e got your nice clean harmonic free signal coming
out of y~ur bandpass filter .. we're on the home run. All tha t's
left is tol ge the signal up the aerial feeder to the aerial and
we're aWfY. BUT the aerial cable needs to MATCH the TX's
output stag at one end and the aerial at the other. This cable
like the fx• output, the connectors and the aerial has an impedence
a$d o match this should be 5012.. It also needs LOW
LOSS or jyo r watts will esc. ape as heat. Not the same as a bad
VSWR 1he e you lose energy in the TX, a good VSWR does
not mea t e cable's okay. Decent cables for short runs are
UR76 a d RG56U. For longer runs or higher powers use
UR67. ( R 7 and UR..76 are available fron Cirkit).
AE.RLa. S
At I t, the aerial! You can nm a pirate knowing little of
TX's, bu i you know nothing of aerials you'll have few listeners.
s4 y u must read a book on it. I recommend 'The Two
Metre lte na Handbook' by FC Judd G2BCX. It's a paperback
by ·e mes technical boo ks at £5.95. You may get it in
the libr y. ots in it isn't useful but he goes into things like
propagation matching, VSWR in better detail. All the dimensions
he I 've are for the 2m amateur band,centred on 145mHz.
To conv rt o other frequencies all dimensions (including diameter
o a ial element, etc) should be divided by you r freqency
in z and then multiplied by 145. eg 978mm for 2m
becomes 97 X 145 - 1377mm for 103mHz.

POLA
1
1S TION
One th ·ng to decide is what polarisation to use. The main
ones are RIZONTAL and VERTICAL. To simplify you can
say a ho zo tally placed aerial produces horizontally polarised
radio w ve and a vertically placed one vertically polarised
radio w ve . To receive a horizontally polarised signal you
need a ~ori ontally polarised aerial, and for a vertical one a
vertical!~ p larised aerial. Most receivers on FM have horizontally
pol is d aerials, but all car aerials are vertically polarised.
So what po arisation you go for depends on the audience you
expect. g n Sunday afternoon you'd expect people at home
so use hdriz ntal, while in rush hour you might favour vertical.
You can[ b Id an aerial which splits the power between both,
as used jn egal stations, known as MIXED polarisation. But
the effe1t f radio waves bouncing off buildings etc tends to
twist the p larisation of your signal from horizontal to vertic•
al and v~b~~ ersa, so your signal could still be picked up by the
wrong a11r1a.
Yo~r ransmitt ing site will affect your choice of aerial
(see alsq C 2,How To Get Away With It). In the middle of
the areaj Y u w_ant to cov~r you'll need an OMNIDIRECTIONAL
aenal which transrruts equally all ways, while outside
your coyer ge area you can beam the signal in , with a
DIRECI]IO AL aerial.

The impedence is about 72 St which is close en u~h to 50
to be fed from 50 J't cable without too much power loss.
A half wave dipole used vertically is omnidir cti~nal, but
when used horizontally it has a fig of eight cover ge like this:

which isn't v. useful. Also a dipole needs a ba 1,d feed.
You neeed a BALUN (BAiance to UNbalance) tJ an former ..
These can be easily made out of bits of co-ax c bl . If you
dont do this power will be radiated from the feed r.~n aerial
with an impedence greatly different from 50 tjeeds an
IMPEDENCE TRANSFORMER Also made out of b ts ~f co-ax,
see aerial book for details. j
Before going on air get a low VSWR by a ju~ting the
position of the aerial and any adjustable pieces. illlj for 2:1
or less. Use low power into the aerial when tunin it ; up and
adjusting, if using lOO's of watts and a bit came of( in your
hand the VSWR could be so bad as to blow the iipal :transistor.
For the same reason check the continuity of th~ aehal with
an ohmmeter before plugging in, to be sure its wh~t its meant
to be, eithP.r a short circuit or an open one, depenltl:li~ on the
type.A dipole should be an open circuit . ·
i
SITING :
Siting is very important. Height is the main , ctbr, even
more than watts! Since VHF radio waves go almost in straight
lines. 100w in your front room will o~y reach ~bu~ neighbours,
while 5w up high and unblocked will go 5 m1~s 4>r more.
The waves do bend a bit so you'll cove~ more than o~ can see
but its hard to say how much. GO for 1tt

THE FREQUENCY COUNTER
If you can get hold of one setting up an exciter is so much
easier, you can see what frequency you're on and if its drift .
ing. You don't need a physical connection to the circuit to
use it as this can upset things. Either connect a single bit of
wire to the input or use a BNC lead ending in a pair of crocodile
clips clipped together to form a little loop.Frequenc y
Counters are normally sensitive enough to get a reading when
the wire or loop is placed near a coil. You might get lots of
other readings as you move it about..look for a stable one
near the frequency you expect (use receive or a wavemeter
if you're not sure) Its a bit of an art but you'll soon get the
hang. For our purposes a frequency must have:
a) The bandwith, up to at least 150MHz.
b) The Resolution i.e. number of digits on display. Four isn't
good enough, six is OK, 8 is preferable.
The Thandor PFM200A is around £75 plus vat from Cirkit.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The following describes a small VHF FM ransmitter
with an outp ut power of 5 watts, ade uate to
cover a 3 or 4 mile radius reception area fro a suits
able high transmitting site. The microphone or cassette
recorder can be connected direct ly to thi transmitter
. To test and tune it you will need am timeter
a dipmeter and preferably a RF power meter. '

as a buffer. T6 and T7 are cascoded to form a high performance
amplifier, with high stability. The transforme L2 ; L3

If the transmitte r is tuned up at a frequency of about
98 Mhz (see later) the desired frequency can be set ith C16
without the power output falling below 4 watts, i.e. it should
not be necessarv to re-tune.
When drilling the printed circuit board (PCB) use 3mm
diameter for mounting holes, 1mm diameter for t · mers and
coils, and 0.8mm diameter for the rest. Mark the ounting
holes on the bottom of the case.

We reprint here complete details of a more sophisticated
5W TX which has been translated and
developed by our Radio Support Group in Bristol.
The approximate cost of parts (excluding PCB
"oard and case) is a mere £16, once you 'ue got

Begin by constructing the low frequency section and the
oscillator and the buffer, i.e. all the parts in Fig~re A of
the circuit diagram. First mount the resistors, then the diodes.
The symbol for a diode in the circuit diagram is an arrow with
a bar in front of it. The bar corresponding to the broad ring of
the diode and the varicap, and the middle lead on the BB204.
Next mount the capacitors and trimmers. Be careful when
bending the leads of the ceramic capacitors near the body of
the capacitor, as it can crack. Ensure the elecrolitic and tant alum
capacitors aze mounted the right way round. Finally
mount the semiconductors and the coil Ll. The coil should
touch the PCB with all its turns (windings) and should be
inserted with no tension on the turns. After testing stick it to
the PCB with UHU (glue). This will improve frequency stability
and help prevent microphony. The coils are best wound on
drill bits of the correct diameter . R23 and C19 are soldered l1,~
turns from the cold end of the coil (thats the end connected
to earth) . Use solder sparingly to avoid damaging the coil.
Mount the semiconductors the right way round. The pinouts
are shown from below.

Next mount th~ transistors. First T6 and T7. he transistors
should be mounted close to the PCB (2-3m ) . This is
especially important for the emitter of T7 (bas~ to earth).
Ensure that nothing metallic touches T7's case as his is connected
internally to its collector. Now mount th MRF237.
Slightly countersink the base and collector holes o the under side
of the board with a 3mm drill. This is to pr~nt a short
circuit between the transistor's base and collector leads with
the earth plane. Mount the transistor underneath the board
onto the earth plane, having first put some heatsink compound
on the bottom of the transistor (ie between the t sistor and
the board) . Push the transistor against the PCB and older base
and collector on top. You can eithe r cut off the e itter lead
beforehand (this is connected internally to the cas ) or put it
through its hole, and bend it so it can be soldered t the screen
to the left of T8 (to be put on later). Using a hi h powered
soldering iron (at least 50w) solder the case of the t ansistor to
the earth plane. This has to be done as fast as possi le. Rather
hot and fast than slow and cold!
Now wind and mount the remaining coils. It dpesn't matter
in which sense you wind them (clock or anti~lock-wise)
except that they should stand at right angles to ea h other (at
each stage) and be as far as possible from the sides f the_ case.
This is especially importan t for 14 and 16. L6 should be
approx. 5mm above the PCB. .

washers, spacers and nuts. Don't forget to put some heatsink
compound between the transistor and the case.
The screens to the left of T6 and T8 are made from bits
of single or double sided PCB. They should be measured to
fit neatly with the sides and top of the case. Where a PCB
track goes from one chamber to the next the screen will have
to filed at the bottom to prevent shorting. Watch the trimmers
when soldering!
The circuit is complete now, only Dr3, Dr4, Dr5 are missing.
Connect 12v to the input of the 8v regulator and to the
top of R27. There should be 11 current of 30-50 mA. The collector
of T6 should be at 10-11\'. If it is 0v, L2 is an open circuit.
If the voltage is too low, R28 has to be increased, and if
too high (rarely) decrease R28. Now mount Dr3. Put trimmer
C27 into mfddle position. Turn C26 so it is ¼ meshed. Connect
the 12v supply again, the current should be 80-120 mA.
Write down the ·current and then adjust C26 and C27. The
current consumption will change and T7 will get hotter than
T6 (but should still be cool enough to touch). If the curren t
consumption is still 50 mA as before there is a mistake somewhere.
There should be a 12v on the case of T7. If there are
no short circuits and no tanta lum capacitors connected the
wrong way round (Do check each stage meticulously before
connecting the supply) the only possibility is a broken trimmer.
If you have a dip meter or absorption wavemeter hold
it near JA and tune through .. ie check there is no spurious out put
on other frequencies. Switch off again.
Finally mount Dr4 and Dr5 and clip a heatsink onto the

the cable by soldering a suitable plug onto the end to a
dummy load via a Voltage Standing Wave Radio meter (VSWR
meter) with power indication. Alternatively use the
ciicuit in Fig.2 as the dummy load and a VSWR meter without
power indication .
NEVER use the t ransmitter without a load! Short circuits
can destroy the MRF237 !
Check with an ohm meter that your dummy load has a
resistance of 50 ohm. Now adjust your power supply to a
maximum current of 800mA (if you can, that is). Adjust the
trimmers C26 ... ¼ C27 ... ½ C32 ... ¼ C33 ... ¼ (ie. C26 ¼

After switching on watch simultaneously power output
and input current. Tune for max output power. Use a brass or
aluminium tuning tool with an insulated handle. Tune C26,
then C27 (doesn't have much effect) then C32, lastly C33. For
the Ist 2 trimmers increasing power output results in an
increase in input current. Not so with the final stage, if you
mistune that current consumption can get too high.
Some power supplies go mad with high frequencies .. try
and get one which is high frequency stabilised. Very careful
people start tuning with low power supply voltages, but the
stage supplied by the voltage regulator needs 12v to make
sure the V regulator is working properly. You should repeat
the tun ing several times to get the feel of it. Maximum output
power is 6 watts with a 12v supply and a MRF237, which corr•
esponds to an input current of 750 mA to the whole circuit, of
which 640mA goes to the MRF237. Under these conditions
the transistor dissipates 8w (as heat) which it can handle if it
has good heatsinking. If you have a trial run outside the case,
the earth plane will just about keep the transistor cool
The MRF237 can cope with 700mA for some time, but bear
in mind that the voltage of a lead/acid battery can be up to
13.5 volts . .ie its better to lower the outp ut power by 0.5w,
wh_ich isn't not iceable, than to risk low reliability by the transistor
running too hot and blowing.
Using the formula I = w/v ('iv over v), you can calculate
the maximum allowable input current for ·a part icular supply
voltage V, and W = 8 watts. The power can be easily reduced
by adjusting C27. You should only do this after everything is
built into the case as the sides of the case affect the coils and
lower the circuit's amplification. In any case there is enough
spare gain in the circuit to tune it uncritically and still supply
the MRF237 with enough input drive. With a dipmeter switched
to absorption wavemeter mode check all stages are working
on only the oscillator frequencv. If the amplifier stages
have sufficient gain the tuning should be completely uncritical
and the oscillator should have good stability, even when used
outside the case. This is in spite of the broadband circuit des•
lgn. If C26 is completely enmeshed at maximum outpu t power
then pull the turns of L4 apart slightly.
Now mounting the board onto the case. Drill holes above
the trimm ers in the top of the case so the final tuning of the
trimmers and R19 can be done with the top in place. Drill
holes also for the switches, sockets and LED. Power supply
and output sockets should be on one of the shorter sides. In
the high frequency part of the board put thin copper foil
round tbe edge of the PCB, as far as the eartn plane extends
to, and ro nd the edges of the screening walls. Solder on both
sides. of t e PCB and the screening walls. Now using spacers,

Now he final tuning. This is the same as the trial run.
You shoul not use a dummy load with a SWR worse than

FOOTNOTES
Here is some info for people who aren't too knowledgeable
about high frequency circuitry, and who probably have
had even Jess experience on a practical level.
1. COMPONEN1'S SHOULD HA VE SHORT LEADS.
Every additional unnecessary length of wire in VHF circuits
increases the chances of undesirable oscillations (properly
called parasitic osclllations). To guard against this solder
components as close to the Pcb as you can, tc get an unambiguous
output on jmit ONE frequency!
2. WE WON'T GET ANYWHERE WITHOUT EARTH.
The case m11st be earthed. ie be at zero volts potential
relative to the negative side_ of the supply. Use a tag bolted to
the output sockets' mounting holes. Solder a thick bit of braided
wire between the tag and the neg. supply input socket.
This will earth the case, but the circuit board still needs earthing.
There might be an earth contact from the MRF237 to the
heatsink to the case but its bette r to provide an additional safe
earth connection. Another piece of thick braided wire will
work. Solder one end to the earth plane and connect the other
to the case near the power supply connections.
If you use metal connectors for the microphone and tape
recorder input sockets theY. will be earthed through the case.
If you use plastic ones you'il have to solder a wire between the
earth tag on the connector and the earth plane on the board.
Better still regardless of choice of connector is to use a piece
of screened audio co-ax.
3. EARTHLY DELIGHTS,
Its important to use a double sided PCB for the High Frequency
stages, so that any part of the circuit can be easily eartthed.
4. HEAT HAS TO GET OUT.
If, for eg, the threaded bolt of a high power transistor has
broken off its no use trying to solder it back on. A soldered
joint do~sn't transfer heat at all well, so either the transis-

Even a set p like "threaded bolt- heatsink compound- heatsink

enough heft to the outside air. (But here we're talk ing about
mega pow r situations you wont face with you r 5 watt er).
5. CAN Y U PUT ANY ONE IN ANY POSITION?
No. e'll have to wait till after the revolution for that.
If you wa t to use different transistors than those mentioned
you'll hav to check the pin outs to see which is base,
collector, tc. There are nearly as many pin outs as there are
transistors. Check in a catalogue or data book that replacements
are ompatible.
6. MATCHMAKING
If you wapt to use a telescopic aerial check the matching
before eacp use. You'll get much better results with a proper
aerial. Yo might get a better match without using the full
ext-ension. How far you can pull such an aerial out depends
(among ot er things) on the transmitting frequency .. Matching
can on y properly be done with a VSWR meter, thats why
its a basic iece of test gear .. See later under AERIALS.
WHERE GET THE PARTS:
Crick] wood Electronics, for instance, stock everything
except th ferrite beads and the wire. Their MRF237 is rather
expensive £7.05).
Mapli has most of the bits except some semiconductors,

Cirkit stocks most of the bits including the FX1115
ferrite be%~ (comes in packs of 10), the other ferrite bead,
and the s lver coated copper wire. They don't stock all the
semicondu tors but their MRF237 is cheaper (£4.46).

80 Watt Amp
General Description .
The following describes a 80w VHF FM ampli 1er. Input
and output impedences are 50 ohm. Output power i 80w with
a 12.5v supply and 15w input power. Its .possible o increase
the input power to 25w but this does not incre se output
power significantly. You shouldn't use more th 26w of
input power without using an input attenuator .
The power supply has to be much more serious ffair than
for a 25w design. The power amp can draw up t 14A DC.
Adding this to the current drawn by a 26 watt tran itter and
we're talking 16A. You'll have to work with a car batte ry or
similar lead/acid battery rated at least 20Ah. If yo have a RF
stabilised mains power supply with a 20A output capability
you could apply 13.6 volts to ihe amplifier and chieve an
output power of 110w. We suggest you only try his if you
have proper heatsinking and guaranteed low SWR. he manufacturers
data sheet says dont exceed 100w output power (on
the transistor) . The bandwidth of this amp is 6Mh for a 20%
decrease. You can only use this bandwidth if yo use a low
pass filter on the outpu t, otherwise the simple bui t in bandstop
filter 16 /Ci0 (tuned to the 2nd'harmonic) ill restrict
the usable bandwidth to 2 Mhz.
Our prototype used a relay to provide rever e polarity
protection. Three LED's indicate ready, reverse p larity, and
high temperature . On reaching 90degrees C the mplifier is
disconnected from the supply. The transmitter f eding this
amplifier should also be connected via this relay, the power
transistor doesn't take kindly to having input powe applied to
it when it doesn't have a supply voltage.
The amplifier power supply should be conn c,ed using
crocodile clips or big piugs ... something like a DIN plug could
not handle the current. The supply cables shoul be of 3-5
square mm cross section and no longer than 100cm.
CIRCUIT
The heart of the circuit is the RF power tran istor MRF
246. This is a controlled Q transistor with intern I base and
collector matching. This transistor is designed for t e 145-176
Mhz VHF band and exhibits broad band character i ties within
this range. The circuit is tuned as the developmen of a linear
amplifier, and would require extensive knowledge f the transistor
and extensive calculations. The transistor's c aracteriso,

ties in the frequency band we are interested in are not published
by the maker and we you'd need loads of expensive test
gear to find them for yourself. Therefore this circuit was developed
mainly by experiment. If you had all the test gear you
could probably achieve a better bandwdth and greater harmonic
suppression.
At the base and collector of the MRF246 are the relatively
high value capacitors C4 and C5. These are part of the
low pass impedence matching networks for input and output .
Enormous currents flow through these capacitors so they
have to be specially chosen eg Unelco mica _capacitors or; Erie
high Q chip capacitors with low pass· C3G<lialectric. Because
of the small size of the chip capacitors they've a tendency to
overheat. Avoid this by using a combinat ion in parallell to add
up to the correct value, which is 440 -550 nf. The only variable
component of the input network is the trimmer C3. This
allows the input network to be tuned across a wide range of
frequencies, The input network has a narrower bandwidth
than the output network.
The transistor MRF245 operates i:n class C mode, and so
has no base bias, Drl ensures this condition is met. The power
supply voltage is applied to the collector via L7. The outpu t
impedence transformation back to 50 ohm is performed by
three pi networks with low pass characteristics. This network
is tuned with C7. L6 and C7 form a bandstop filter which is
tuned to the2nciharmon ic. It works by providing a low impedence
path to earth for frequencies in that region, thereby
reducing the power output of the 2ndharmonic . If you can't
get a dipped mica capacitor for C9 use two or three readily
available ones in parallel. The purpose of this capacitor is to
isolate the DC supply from the aerial outpu t, it doesn't do any
matching. Using ceramic capacitors in parallel is necessary cos
it keeps the parasitic inductance small. Similarily for Cl use
a dipped mica or 2 or 3 ceramic capacitors in parallel.
The power supply decoupling is very important. The
capacitors Cll, C12 and C13 have different orders of
magnitude as they're only efficient at preventing parasitic
oscillations in a particular frequency range. Together they' ll
do it over a wide range. The supply is furth er decoupled by
choke Dr2 and · feedthrough capacitor C14. The amp is protected
from reverse power supply polarity by a relay. The
relay's contacts only close, allowing the supply voltage to the

amplifier, if the supply is connected the right way round.
If the relay fails by, eg, the contacts welding together, which
can happen with 16A, Dl will short the supply voltage and the
fuse will blow. Reverse polarity on plug PLl is indicated by
the green LED D4. 'Ready' is indicated by red LED D3. The
amplifier is protected by a thermal switch. If the heatsink
exceeds 90 degrees c the supply to the relay coil is interrupted
which diconnects the power to the amp. This is shown by
yellow LED D5. The amp is reconnected when the heatsink
cools below 70 C. Plug PL2 supplies the exciter (12v max 5
A) which should also be protected from overheating or reverse
polarity.
CONSTRUCTION
Use double sided glass fibre PCB. The suggested layout is
only one of many possibilities. If you change the layout do
NOT alter the size or shape of the islands on the PCB to
which any of the inductors Ll to L5 or the transistor are soldered.
This is to ensure the inductors have the same bending
radius and therefore inductance as they have on our prototype
The suggested circuit plan was designed to use miniature mica
compression trimmers. Anything else will probably be too big
to fit on our design. If you enlarge the PCB by 10mm on both
sides you'll have more room for alternative set-ups.
You should have all parts on hand and then redesign the
PCB layout accordingly, bearing in mind what you're going to
do about beatsinking and putting the whole thing in a case.
You might need to drill another hole in the PCB to accomodate
the temperature switch. Decide how you'll mount and position
the feedthrough capacitor,bea ring in mind that its fragile
and shouldn't be subjected to any mechanical stresses.
We recommend you introduce a second PCB, completely
screened from the High Frequency PCB, on which is mounted
the reverse polarity protection relay, the LED's and the DC
output socket PL2.
The high frequency input and output sockets should be
mounted on the case directly over the PCB so they're perpen icular
to the PCB. Or the sockets can be over the ends of the
PCB, parallel to the board, in which case the length of the PCB
dictates the length of the case and heatsink in this dimension.

Lb C10
The socke must have a durable and flawless connection to
the earth lane on the PCB. The best thing is to connect a
thick wire from the PCB earth plane to the case next to the
sockets. E ther solder directly to the case material, or preferably
use ta s bolted through the sockets. mounting holes. Most
BNC sock ts have their own tags which you can use.
Drill e holes in the PCB. Apart from the holes for the
transistor he PCB should be bolted to the heatsink at least
twice on . he base and collector side of the PCB. ? Use 6BA/
M3 or larg r bolts. Solder brass or copper strips along the long
edges of t e PCB to connect the top and bottom earth planes
together, do the same by soldering strips through the hole
where the mitter flanges of the transistor are to be soldered.
This is so the emitt er will be connected to both the top and
bottom e th planes next to the body of the transistor. If
your PCB much wider than our design we recommend you
introduce uch 'through contacts' two times each near the
emitter. T ere should also be a throu gh contact near the feedthrough
ea acitor. To do this drill a small bole in the PCB,
insert a th ck wire, and solder on both sides. The earth plane
should ha e a good connection both to the high frequency
sockets an the negative supply connection.
After these plumbing jobs mount the transistor from
above. Sol, er the whole length of the emitter flanges. These
are the on s on the outside. The collector is the smaller of the
two inner anges. Then mount capacitors C4 and C5. Cut 11
to L5 out f copper or brass sheet and mount these as shown
on the ~_ia ram together with Cl to C9. When soldering the
capacitors ake the joint as large as possible to keep stray inductance
lo and achieve better heat conduction. The loose
ends of Cl and C9 will be soldered directly to the central contacts
of t e BNC or UHF sockets later on. When soldering
the trimme ensure to solder the contact which is connected
to the rot ting part to earth, otherwise you'll have big poblems
tryingi to tune the circuit with metallic instruements.
Before you solder in L 7 you should mount Cll, C12 and C13
then Dr2 a d Drl. Leaving Drl out would be disastrous (positive
base v ltage = high collector current = new transistor).
The feedth ough capacitor C14 can be fitted now, or left till
later, depe ing on which construct ion you've chosen.

After finishing work on the PCB it can be bol ed to the
heatsink. Put a thin coat of heatsink compound on t e bottom
of the mounting flange of the transistor. Bolt this fljnge to the
heatsink with 6BA or M3 bolts. The PCB is then bo ted to the
heatsink in 4 places, using shakeproof washers abo ~ and below
the PCB at such a height so as not to flex the ~CB or put
any stress on the t ransistors leadouts. If this is don~ right the
PCB will end up about 2mm above the heatsink. !Obviously
you'll have drilled holes in the heatsink corresppndi ng to
those in the PCB and the transistor mounting flanges The use
of shakeproof washers ensures good contact on ~oth sides
and stops loosening by vibration. Provisionally attjlch a fuse
and the input and output sockets and you can start ~\ming.
T~rno I
Tuning the amplifier is relatively simple, but yo~ have to
have the right test gear. You'll need a 100w power m ter and
a correspondingly rated 50 ohm dummy load. Most s ortwave
dummy loads can be used up to lO0Mhz, eg. the we 1 known
oil cooled tin models. At 80w they can be used with , ut the oil
for several minutes. If you use a dummy load in conj nction
with a feed through power metre (or calibrated SW meter)
this must be able to cope with 100w at l00Mhz as II. The
best solution is to get a complete dummy load powe meter.
For brief standing wave and relative power measure ents
you can use the normal little SWR meter , but its recomme.
nded that you reduce their sensistivity by adding a ~dsistor o~
abou t 10 I< ohms in series with each gang of the twirl potentiometer
. This prevents the meter indicating FSD wit~ the sensitivity
set just above zero. Also the matching of the ~ntiometer
gangs is not guaranteed at the extremes of its tr~vel,
which could result in a wrong SWR reading. If you u e the
SWR meter for more than brief periods, at a power ver 40w,
the diodes will get warm and your readings will be il acc~rate.
So switch on transmitte r and amp just to take a eadmg
and then switch off.
To tune the2ndharmonic filter you 'II need a dip meter
or an absorbtion wavemeter (or a spe"tl'llm analyser f you've a

few grand to spare). You'll need two ammeters, a 5A for the
TX (transmitter) power supply and a 15A for the amp power
supply, assuming they're not part of any mains supply units
you may be using. Useful, but not necessary, are two volt
meters, one of each supply.
To sum up ,to tune the amp you need: A transmitter ,
ideally 15-20w output power,tuned to the desired frequency.

A lead to connect the Tx to a SWR meter. A lead to connect

power supply or 12v car battery. A 15A ammeter . A lead to
connect the amplifier into the power meter. A power meter . ..
A lead to connect the power meter into the dummy load. The
dummy load. The dip meter (see diagram)
Tuning is as follows. Switch on the amplifier. It should
draw practically no current, Now switch on the 15w TX
which obviously has to work properly . Read the
5A ammeter and the SWR meter. The SWR value will
probably be bad and the amp still drawing hatdly any current ..
and the power meter showing a low reading. Ca~fully adjust
C3. Suddenly the current shown on the 15A ammeter will
rise sharply, and the power meter will follow more or less.
Adjust C3 so the current is about 7A, Now adjust C7 for maximum
power output, for this Cl0 should be completely unmeshed
(min. capacitance) .Adjust C3 and C7 alternately to trim
the amplifier for max power output. Depending on the supply
voltage and the thickness of the supply leads you should be
able to get 80- 110 watts. The little $WR meter between the
TX and the amp. should show a good SWR reading (less than
1 : 2) The amplifier current consumption should be between
10 and 14A. The transmitter's consumpton should be about
the same as if it was driving a dummy load (check it if you
can't remember) .
If you run into problems and th ings aren't clean switch itt
all off. Think. This stuff is power electro nics . .ie it can get real
hot and start smouldering.
After this rough tuning tune the amp's harmonic filter.
Set up the dipmeter so it covers 100·250Mhz. It has to be
near the dummy load in a position that isn't screened. If you -·- ··•··--·-- ------ - ------.......J---- - - --"--- -- ---------- ------

can't find such a J>O.~iUoyno u could for example unscrew the
top off the dummy load, but beware, you're now transmittini!
Approaching with the dipmeter you'll detect a definite
indication at the desired frequency, even at some distance.
Now set the dipmeter to double the frequency and approach
the dummy load again. Tune the dipmeter .. you shouldn't
get any other readings but the one on double the transmitting
frequency. If you get a reading that increases steadily as you
tune up the scale of the dipmeter this is an aperiodal coup!•
ing to the dummy load .. the readings are meaningless.
If you get close enough to the dummy load to get aperiodic
coupling but still no indicat ion of the first harmonic, the amp
should be OK as far as that harmonic is concerned , but there
is usually a fairly strong indication at double the frequency
after rough tuning.
Keep the dipmeter in position tuned to the 2nd harmonic
and using an insulated screwdriver with a short blade adjust
ClO. Suddenly the indication on the dipmeter will disappear
completely, but the output power will fall .as well. Adjust C7
to improve the power outpu t again, and then adjust ClO to
obliterate the 2nd harmonic again. This will give you optimum
tuning for a bandwidth of about lMhz.
If you want a wider bandwidth you'll have to tune U?
differently. When performing the rough tuning (Cl0 completely
unmeshed as before) turn C7 further than to achieve max
power so that the power output and current consumption decrease
again. (output power will be 65-SOw).Now tune the TX
to the lowest frequency of the desired frequency range and
minimise the :2nd harmonic using a dipmeter and ClO as described
above. Check the power output across your desired frequency
range.
The wider the bandwidth you want the more output
power you'll have to sacrifice. Tuning for a bandwidth of more
than 4Mhz involves a lot of high precision work. C3 could be
used to keep the output power constant across a wide bandwidth
but this can result in the in SWR readings of 1:3 between
the TX and the amp at the ext emes of the band. In this situation
the TX has to be cooled well.
PARTS
The biggest problem in building a VHF amp for this output
power is getting the necessary parts. Often CB and amateur
radio specialist shops wont have all of them. Most are to
be had by mail order from various sources.
The MRF 245 and MRF24 7
are also stocked by Raedek Electonics at £33 each. Phone for
current prices (See CONTACTS below). The fixed capacitors
C2, C4, C5, C6 and CS are special due to their high quality and
extremely low inductance leads. Use either dipped mica or
high quality ceramic chip capacitors with C3J dialectric. The
dipped mica capacitors are made by UNELCO. Also check out
the SEMCO range of capacitors in the Cirkit catalogue. There
are two different sizes,the principle of construc tion is the same
Several layers of metal foil are insulated from each other by
layers of very thin mica. Every second layer of foil is led to the
outside to the tag of the capacitor, the other foil layers connect
to the metal clip holding the system together. This side
should be soldered to earth and the tag soldered to the PCB
islands. The ceramic chip capacitors (ERIE high Q ones with
C3G dialectric) are symmetrical. At each end of the almost
square chip (about 4X4mm) is a solderable metal strip. Which
one of these is earth doesn't matter. Cirkit stock a small range
of chip ceramics. They call them Leadless Ceramic.
If you can't get the right value you should think of using
smaller values in parallel. Unelco capacitors can be soldered
on top of each other if you haven't space. This shouldn't cost
too much if you don't build too many amps. For C4 and C5
definitely use the larger dipped mica. If you can only get
ceramic chip use two in parallel cos of their tendency to heat
up. For the trimmers C3 and C7 you can't use anything but
mica compression trimmers. . These work by compressing
metal foils insulated from each other with mica. By tightening
the bolt you compress and incJease the capacitance. For Cl0
you should use a miniature air spaced trimmer cos of its low
capacity.
To make the strip inductors get some copper or brass
sheet metl of about 0.1mm thickness. This can be had hopefully
fr~m , raft shops. The sil_vecr oated copper wire is available
from C1rk1,. You could use msulated copper wire for 17.
The 1eatsink largely determines the looks and construction
of the amp. There are special heatsinks the above described
PCB can be sunk into. If you can't find one best use a
standard heatsink of enough cooling capacity, ie. thermal
resistance ess than 0.6 degrees C/W. The shape of the heatsink
will deteijine the problems when designing the heatsink protection,
fee through capacitor, case, etc.
For b tter bandwidth use MRF247 instead of MRF 245.
NaturfllY you wouldn't even consider using an amp of
this powe~ into some crummy piece of TV co-ax cable, Get
some Unir~dio 67 from Cirkit.

FM Aerials: Construction Plans.
These plans include details for the construction of antennas suitable for the FM
broadcast band. Their is nothing mag ic al about their design, just basic rules
go verning the construction of an tenna systems. They can therefore be modified to
work at other frequencies as well. They work equally wel I for the transmission of
AM, F M, PM, PCM, and ON.
BASIC RULES:
(1) An antenna and its transmission line Should have the same value of impedance.
(2) An half - wave dipole antenna has a nominal feed Impedance of 75 ohms.
(3) Two similar antennas connected in parallel have 1/2 of the normal impedance.
(4) Generally, the effe ctive power increa ses directly to the number of antennas u sed.
(5) An effective power gain in one direction results in a power loss somewher e el se .
(6) The re is always a loss of power in a transmission line.
(7) The smalle r the size of a transmission line, the greater Its loss.
(8) A 1/4 wavelength of transmission line can act as an impedance transformer .
(9) A 1 /2 wavelength of t rans mission line exhit,its the same impeda nce at both ends.
(10) A 1/4 wavelength of transmission line can act as an RF decoup l er .

(12) Radio waves tr ave l at the speed of li ght th rough space (and air).
(13) Rad io waves travel s lower over wires and th rough cables.
(14) A super low 1/S'NR is not needed, a VSWR of 1 . 5 or even 2 to 1 is acceptable.
(15) A 100 foot piece of RG-8 coax allows only 63"/. of the power to reach the antenna.
(16) A 100 foot pie ce of RG-59 coax allows only 50o/o of the power to reach the antenna.
(17) Radio waves travel at .6 6 light speed through cab les with "poly" insulation.

S IMPLE STACKED VERTICAL DIPOLES (Fig . 1)
This is a very simple yet effective antenna. It is constructed from length s of
RG-8 coaxi a l cab le. The uppermost radiator is j ust a small .wire of 1/Sth inch or
less in diameter . lt may be soldered to the center co n dJ ctor of ·the coax, or you
may simply use the inner condJctor of the coax Itself. You can hold tt up straight
by attaching a wood splint along Its length and sec uring that sp l int to the coax below.

Finishing touches include polishing the copper pipe and coating it with clear
l acquer. Close up any holes with silicone sealant to keep out moisture . Check
with an ohmmeter for shorts between dipole elem ent s and shorts ·~etween the
elem e nt s and the supporting boom . Ch eck also for contin.>ity between the center
pin of the SO-239 and th e lower dipol e e lement.
Mount on the mast so the $0 - 239 is facing down . A little grease on the threads
when you screw on the plug later will help to .keep moisture out.
When stacking these un its the dipole connected to the coax braid MUST BE
POINTING UP to maintain the proper phase relationship between units. The length
of the tittle mounting stub (top "U" bolt) is not critical, 2" to 4", it's just fur a
mounting spot for the "U " bolt anyway.

AN OMNIDIRECTIONAL.,_ STACKABLE , HORIZON TAL DIPOLE(~
The pr evious ver tic al dipol e can be modified to make a horizontally polarized
antenna. By simply rotating the dip ole e lements (and the "T" fitting) at the end of
supp ort boom 90 degrees you have a horizontal antenna . The coverage pattern would
be bi-directional however, sim i lar to Fig . A, pattern # 2 .
By bending the di pole elements forward slightly we can further modify the antenna
so it will present a near ly omni-directional coverage. The coverage wou l d then
look like Fig. A, Pattern# 1 .
Of course bending copper pipe is a bit of a chOr e so we' 11 use 45 degree 1 /2 "
copper fittings instead . With the exc ep tion of the above modifications and the
additi on of two 45 degree fittings, the constr uc tion is the same as the vertical dipole.
Just use those i nstru c tions for its assembl y.
When completed the dipole arms shou ld be horizontal, the mounttng end of the
support boom vertical , and the $0-239 po inting down. When stacking these units
be sure that right dipo le eleme nt is the one with the coax braid connected to It . This
is neces sary to maintain p r'oper phasing. If proper phasing is not maintained on e
antenna will tend to cancel out th e ra diatio n from one of the other units - result is
terrible cove rage or no coverage at all!

STACKING AN TENNAS FOR MORE GAIN Figs. E - I)
When we speak of an antenna as having gain we are really talking about its
EFFECTNE RADIA TE D POWER or simply its ERP. The antenna can be made to
concentrate the power fed to tt by s ending it out in one or more direction s . This
m eans however that some o ther di rection will not receive as rn.,_ch power. Simply,
more distance in one direction means less distance In another direction.
Stacking of vertical antennas tends to lower the r adiation angle. Less power Is
radiated up toward the s ky, being channeled outward instead . This of course In
creases the coverage area . F ig. D shows the relationship of stacking versus the
effective distance. Pattern# 1 Is for a si ngle antenna . Pattern #2 shows the results
of 2 stacked verticals with an ERP of about 2 X . Pattern# 4 shows a 4-bay antenna.
The above Is the case where the antennas are mounted on a wooden support. If a
metal tower or mast is used it wilt reflect some of the power forward. This also
results In additional ERP. This raises the overall ERP by a factor of about 2 . This
means that a 4-bay vertical on a metal mast could have an ERP of 2 times 4 for a
total of 8 times the power! Of course coverage area is lost behind the tower as we
c, a.,,,,,.;, .. ,er . fhlS 1s Shown as the# 50 with a circle around it. This is piece of
50 ohm coax 1/4 wavelength long. This Is either 19 1/2 " or 24 1/4" long depending
on whether you are using poly or foam coax. The cables from the antennas to the
coax T (Y1) may be of any convenient length BUT •••• they must be the SAME length.
If they are different lengths the phasing between antennas will not be correct!
Highest gai n is acheived when the spacing between centers of antennas is about
.8 X wavelength in air. Th is Is 94 1/2 inches at 100 MHz. (E = 94 1/2")
Fig . G shows a 4-bay vertical system. Fig. H shows a 2-bay vertical with a 2-
bay horizonta l . You could just as easily have a 4-bay horizontal for Fig. G. In
the case of Fig. H the vertical antenras can be fitted inbetween the horizontal unit s.
Thts takes up a little less tower space. Note this is also done in the 4-bay vert i'Cal,
4-bay horizontal system of Fig. I. Dimension Eis still 94 1/2" at 100 MHz.
The length of connecting cables Y2 may also be of any convenient length BUT both
must be of the sanne length! Aga in in Fig s. G and H you are paralleling two 75 ohm
impedances (Y2 + Y2) . T t, is point may be fed with a 50 ohm coax (\/SVI/R of 1 . 33 to 1J.

Although a metal tower will produce a shadow area behind omni- direc tional
horizontals also, it is not nearly as pronounced as with verticals . In most cases
it Is not worth worrying about.
T he most prac tical rumber of horizontal bays se ems to be 4. More than that
tends to concentrate the "beam" of radiation too rroch . It gets out furth er but can
actua lly travel 11ove r 11 nearby receiving antennas .
The amo un t of distance obtained related to effective increases in power is e"'-'al
to the square root of the power increase. These relation ship s are shown below:
Power Increa s e Distance Power Increase Distance
2 1 ,4 X 7 2.65 X
3 1.73 X 8 2 .83 X
4 2 . 0 X 9 3.0 X
5 2 .23 X 10 3 . 16 X
6 2.45 X
This holds true for increases in tr ansmitter power a l so. Doubling your transmitt er
power re su lts in only a 1. 4 X increase in distance .

Fig. F sho ws two stacked antennas. The y may bot h be vertical, or both horizontai .
or may be one of eaeh . If bo th antennas are the same po lari za tion it would have an
ERP of 2. If you ha ve one of each then the ERP is 1 - but with both norizontal and
vertical polarization . The total feed impedanc e at the coax T ls now 1/2 of 75 ohms .
This 37 . 5 ohm impedance can be fed with a 50 Ohm coax with only a 1 .33 to 1 VSW R .
If you want to feed it with 75 ohm coax you must have a 1/4 wave impedance matching

A bi t of ir'\fo rmation you m ay ftnd dis courag ing . 100 feet of RG- 8 coax allows
only 63 o/o of the transmitter po wer to r each the antenna system. RG-59 is worse!
It only allows 50o/o of the tr ans mitter power to reach the antenna ( 100 feet). In othe r
words, u s e RG -8 a s much as you can , keep th e t ran s mi ss ion l ine sho rt bet ween the
antenna and the ttansmitt e r. Of cour se the higher up your antenn a the better it will

CIRCULAA POLARIZ ATION
You may modify yo ur antenna s yst em to achieve circular polarization. If yo u
stack a ha rizontal unit directly above a vertical unit, so the suppo rt booms are
actually touching, and the horizontal unit s traddles the vertlcal you are close!
Look at Fig. H for a moment. Picture the top horizontal unit resting right on
top of the to p vertical ele m en t. T heir radiation centers wculd be almost at the
same point . Now m ak e the vert ical' s Yl cable any length that ' s ~ent, BUT ,
make the hor izonta l' s YI cable 1/4 wavelength longer! Repeat the above for all
vertical/horizon tal pai r s . A ll the oth e r ca bles and transform e r s rem ain the sam e
as before. ---
Suppressor and Filter:
Construction Plans.
On e of the biggest problems with any transmitter is the product ion of undesired
frequencies. These may be produced by secondary re5Qnant circuits within the
oscillator stage or amplifier stage s. These frequencies have no relationsh ip to
the desired fre quency wh atsoever and may appear anywhere on the bard or out.
Harmonic frequencies, multiples o f the desired· freq.,ency, are produced by the
non-linear characteristics of the amplifying devices themse lves , either tubes or
transistors . This means an FM transmittet' operating at 100 MHz may produce
harmonics at 200, :300,4-00,500 • •• • et c MHz . The most common non-linearity
produced frequencies are the odd harmonics, 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc .
A filter which will reduce or elim inate all but the desired frequency must have a
finite pass-band. Jn the FM band we have a channel width of 200 KHz. This means
the f'i.lter • s pass bandmust not be less than 200 KHz o r signa l quality will suffer.
Unfortunate ly as band width is made narrower in a f'i.lter the i nsertion loss becomes
greater. A compromise then is where an acceptab l e band width (pass band) Joins
an a=eptable insertion loss (power loss). The RF! is tunab le from 80 to 120 MHz.
G eneral pass band and insertion loss characteristics of the PANAXIS RF! are:
Pass Band Inserti on Lo_!Ss_i:!fil_ Power Ou~~o/o 2 Resultant Fleld ~o/.2
2MHz .45 90 95
1 MHz .70 65 92
.5MHz .97 60 90
The extra 1/4 wavelength of cable going to the horizontal unit delays the signal
by 90 degre es . The s ignal is first ra d iated by the vertical, then 90 degrees later As an example, with the RF! adjusted for al MHz ' pass band, the Insertion loss
by the horizontal, then the vertical, then the hor izo ntal , and so on . The signal Is would be . 7 dB, resu l ting in 85o/o of the power being transferred from irput to
now spun out in all directions at 100,000,000 time s each s econd! While the oth er output . This sounds bad until you consider that the f'i.eld strength vol t age decrease s
systems of stacked a nt enn a s gave both horiz ontal and vertical polarizations, this as the square root of the power decrease . In this example the range wou ld be cut
..~ wes-a!+-ether-f)e-~ari-2~ i,, bet., ee . 2o/.,-of-the-range-otairnlbte-wtthettt-the -f.HEei'¾-- ---------- - - --l
The ga in in any one polarization does not change however. When you mix the
polariza tio ns equally you have 1 /2 power going horizontal and 1 /2 power going
vertical (or somewhere in betwe e n). Thls also holds true for the stacked v ert i cals
and horizontals without ci rcu iar polarizat ion.
Example: 1/2 pow er go e s to 2 -bay ver t ical with gain of 2 ... total gain = 1
l/2 power goes to 2 -bay horizontal with gain of 2 ••• total gai n=
Th e r e fore: a 4-bay antenna, with 2 h oriz ontal and 2 vertical has a galn of only
but its a gain of one in each po larizati on .
Now, a final mind bl owe r! Here i s a typical example of what you will b e fighting to
get out a d ecent signal:
Transmitter pow e r = 10 watts = T PO
100 • of RG-8 = 63¾ efficiency = F
4-bay hor i zontal = ga in of 4 (H ) = G
4-bay vertical = gain of 4(V) =G
GOOD LUCK!
TPO X F X G = a ctual ERP
Therefore:
10 x .63 x 4 = 25. 2 watts
However;
only 1/2 of the power is going to
each pola rization, so . •. . you hav e
only 12. 6 watt s (H) and 12. 6 watts

The graph at the le ft ill ustrates a 500 KHz
bandwidth ( - 3dB point) and a 1 dB Insertion
loss. Output drops offr-apidly for frequencies
farthest -ay from the center freq.1ency, in
this 100 MHz is being used as the center . Up
to 30 dB of attenuation at 5 MHz awey from the
center frequency is possib le with proper ad)

50 ohm input/output. S'NR will be about 1 .·s
to 1 w ith 75 ohm input/output , u nless taps are
adjusted for 75 ohm operatio n only.
The coils are a little tricky but if you take your- t!me you should have only a little
troubl e . The two coil s are wound in OPPO SITE DIRECTIONS. This ts important
because when they are installl'!d you'll want the ''tap" po int to be correct . The tap
is at one full turn from the bott om of each coil . The long leg at the bottom of
each coll is part of the impedance of the tap and is requi r ed - do not shorten it by
more than 1/2 inch I
Wind the coil on a 3/8" drill bit shank or otne r 3/8" diameter object . You'll want
6 full turns with extra wi r e left at each end. T ake a short piece of the same wire
size and push it in between a couple of the turns near the end of the coil. Rotate
u - - - " . .. ,,ne holding the spacer wir e between the turns. In this way you ' ll space
each of the turns a wire diameter apart. You cou ld do It of cour-se by simply
pulling th e turns apart but the spacing would not be u ni form or look all thaJ: neatl
With a pair of long (or needle) nose pliers bend the wire ends of the coil at right
a""Qles to the coil turns . See Fig . 2 for more detail. The "top" end of the coil
is the toughest . It must be bent so the end wire comes up and over the supports of
the variable capacitor .
Tne second coil is made in the same manner except it Is wound in the OPPOSITE
DIRECTION, Again, bend the top end wire so It wnl center the coil between the
bottom and top of the box when the end wire Is resting on the variable capacitor's
supports,
Solder the co il s to their respective capacitor supports as shown . The w! r-e
erds at the "top" of the coils are placed very close together and cut off Just before
it c an touch the opposi te capacitor , These two wires , o ne from the "top" of each
coit , are pUrposely placed close to each other . A very small capacity exists between
them - this is your- coup ling capacitor between resonant clrcultsl The closer
they are the gre~er your passband and the greater the powe r transfer. About 3
thlcknesses of this paper fitting between these wires will give about a 2 MHz pass
band . Farther apart will narrow the pass band and reduce power transfer.

OPERATIO N

I
L
r
Operation is very simple . Just comect the output of your trans, nitte r to one of
the coax connecto r s , ColVIElct the other coax co nnector output to your antenna.
The unit is symmetrical so either coax connector may be used as an 1,-.,ut or an
output.
Adjust each variable capacitor to to about the ce nt er of Its range. Co nne ct some
means to monitor the filter's output . This can be an RF voltmeter, an SWR
meter or power meter-. The antenna should be connected or false tuning may
result, You may also use a field strength meter to Indicate when you have runed
the filter for maximum power output. As a last r eso rt you can ev en use the
tuning meter of your FM receiver-. Tune it to your freq..,ency.
Turn on you r transmitter . Tu:\e one filter variable until you g et an output, Then
tune th e other variable capacitor to increase that output. Repeat this se veral times
until both cap acitors have been "peaked" for maximum output.
